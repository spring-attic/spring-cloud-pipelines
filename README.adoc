= Spring Cloud Pipelines

_Documentation Authors: Marcin Grzejszczak, Cora Iberkleid_

Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are tools that allow developers speed up the
time of creating new business features. It's common knowledge however that the
 feature is only valuable if it's in production. That's why companies
 spend a lot of time and resources on building their own deployment pipelines.

This project tries to solve the following problems:

- Creation of a common deployment pipeline
- Propagation of good testing & deployment practices
- Speed up the time required to deploy a feature to production

A common way of running, configuring and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.

== Introduction

In the following section we will describe in more depth the rationale
behind the presented opinionated pipeline. We will go through each deployment
step and describe it in details.

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
.
├── common
├── concourse
├── docs
└── jenkins
----

In the `common` folder you can find all the Bash scripts containing the pipeline logic. These
scripts are reused by both Concourse and Jenkins pipelines.

In the `concourse` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Concourse demo.

In the `docs` section you have the whole documentation of the project.

In the `jenkins` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Jenkins demo.

=== How to use it?

This repository can be treated as a template for your pipeline. We provide some opinionated
implementation that you can alter to suit your needs. The best approach to use it
to build your production projects would be to download the Spring Cloud Pipelines repository as ZIP, then
init a Git project there and modify it as you wish.

[source,bash]
----
$ # pass the branch (e.g. master) or a particular tag (e.g. v1.0.0.RELEASE)
$ SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE=...
$ curl -LOk https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/archive/${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ unzip ${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ cd spring-cloud-pipelines-${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}
$ git init
$ # modify the pipelines to suit your needs
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin ${YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL}
$ git push origin master
----

NOTE: Why aren't you simply cloning the repo? This is meant to be a seed
for building new, versioned pipelines for you. You don't want to have all of our
history dragged along with you, don't you?

==== Centralized pipeline creation

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines to generate pipelines
for all projects in your system. You can scan all your
repositories (e.g. call the Stash / Github API and retrieve the list of repos)
and then...

* For Jenkins, call the seed job and pass the `REPOS`
parameter that would contain the list of repositories
* For Concourse, you'd have to call `fly` and set
pipeline for every single repo

==== Pipeline per repository

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines in such a way that
each project contains its own pipeline definition in
its code. Spring Cloud Pipelines clones the code with
the pipeline definitions (the bash scripts) so the
only piece of logic that could be there in your application's
repository would be how the pipeline should look like.

* For Jenkins, you'd have to either set up the `Jenkinsfile`
or the jobs using Jenkins Job DSL plugin in your repo.
Then in Jenkins whenever you set up a new pipeline for a repo
then you reference the pipeline definition in that repo.
* For Concourse, each project contains its own pipeline steps
and it's up to the project to set up the pipeline.

=== The flow

Let's take a look at the flow of the opinionated pipeline

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow_concourse.png[title="Flow in Concourse"]

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow.png[title="Flow in Jenkins"]

We'll first describe the overall concept behind the flow and then
we'll split it into pieces and describe every piece independently.

=== Environments

So we're on the same page let's define some common vocabulary. We discern 4 typical
environments in terms of running the pipeline.

- *build* environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It's a CI / CD tool worker.
- *test* is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It doesn’t
resemble production, we can't be sure of it's state (which application is deployed there
and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.
- *stage* is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely applications
are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
Typically databases there are filled up with (obfuscated) production data. Most
often this environment is a single, shared one between many teams. In other
words in order to run some performance, user acceptance tests you have to block
and wait until the environment is free.
- *prod* is a production environment where we want our tested applications to be deployed
for our customers.

=== Tests

*Unit tests* - tests that are executed on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases / HTTP server stubs etc. take place. Generally speaking your application should
 have plenty of these to have fast feedback if your features are working fine.

*Integration tests* - tests that are executed on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in memory databases / HTTP server stubs take place. According to the test
pyramid, in most cases you should have not too many of these kind of tests.

*Smoke tests* - tests that are executed on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain most money from e.g. 5 features then you could write smoke tests
 for those 5 features. As you can see we're talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
 the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
 executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.

*End to end tests* - tests that are executed on a system composing of multiple applications.
The idea of these tests is to check if the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, resources to maintain such an environment
and that often those tests are unreliable (due to many different moving pieces like network
database etc.) you should have a handful of those tests. Only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
don't even want to do those and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting you can quickly react when your deployed application
is not behaving properly.

*Performance testing* - tests executed on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle big load of input. In case of our opinionated pipeline
 these tests could be executed either on test (against stubbed environment) or
  stage (against the whole system)


==== Testing against stubs

Before we go into details of the flow let's take a look at the following example.

image::{intro-root-docs}/monolith.png[title="Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing"]

When having only a handful of applications, performing end to end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective it's maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective it's nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.

In case of microservices the scale starts to be a problem:

image::{intro-root-docs}/many_microservices.png[title="Many microservices deployed in different versions"]

The questions arise:

- Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?
  * If I queue deployments people will have to wait for hours to have their tests ran - that can be a problem
- To remove that issue I can have an environment per microservice
  * Who will pay the bills (imagine 100 microservices - each having each own environment).
  * Who will support each of those environments?
  * Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
  them up and running for the whole day?
- In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?
  * If I have development versions then I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
  That can lead to exceptions on production
  * If I test against production versions then I'll never be able to test against a feature under development
  anytime before deployment to production.

One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to... not do end to end tests.

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies"]

If we stub out all the dependencies of our application then most of the problems presented above
disappear. There is no need to start and setup infrastructure required by the dependant
microservices. That way the testing setup looks like this:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="We're testing microservices in isolation"]

Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract]):

- No need to deploy dependant services
- The stubs used for the tests ran on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests
- Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (check http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract] for more information)
- We don't have many slow tests running on a deployed application - thus the pipeline gets executed much faster
- We don't have to queue deployments - we're testing in isolation thus pipelines don't interfere with each other
- We don't have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes

It brings however the following challenges:

- No end to end tests before production - you don't have the full certainty that a feature is working
- First time the applications will talk in a real way will be on production

Like every solution it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
 allows you to configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.

==== General view

The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:

- test the application in isolation
- test the backwards compatibility of the application in order to roll it back if necessary
- allow testing of the packaged app in a deployed environment
- allow user acceptance tests / performance tests in a deployed environment
- allow deployment to production

Obviously the pipeline could have been split to more steps but it seems that all of the aforementioned
 actions comprise nicely in our opinionated proposal.

=== CI Server worker prerequisites

Spring Cloud Pipelines uses Bash scripts extensively. Below you can find the list of software
that needs to be installed on a CI server worker for the build to pass.

TIP: In the demo setup all of these libraries are already installed.

[source,bash]
----
 apt-get -y install \
    bash \
    git \
    tar \
    zip \
    curl \
    ruby \
    wget \
    unzip \
    python \
    jq
----

IMPORTANT: In the Jenkins case you will also need `bats` and `shellcheck`. They are not
presented in the list since the installed versions by Linux distributions might be old.
That's why this project's Gradle tasks will download latest versions of both libraries
for you.

=== Pipeline descriptor

Each application can contain a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
lowercaseEnvironmentName1:
    services:
        - type: service1Type
          name: service1Name
          coordinates: value
        - type: service2Type
          name: service2Name
          key: value
lowercaseEnvironmentName2:
    services:
        - type: service3Type
          name: service3Name
          coordinates: value
        - type: service4Type
          name: service4Name
          key: value
----

For a given environment we declare a list of infrastructure services that we
want to have deployed. Services have

    - `type` (example: `eureka`, `mysql`, `rabbitmq`, `stubrunner`) - this value gets
    then applied to the `deployService` Bash function
        - *[KUBERNETES]* for `mysql` you can pass the database name via the `database`
        property
    - `name` - name of the service to get deployed
    - `coordinates` - coordinate that allows you to fetch the binary of the service.
      Examples: It can be a maven coordinate `groupid:artifactid:version`,
       docker image `organization/nameOfImage`, etc.
    - arbitrary key value pairs - you can customize the services as you wish

==== Pipeline descriptor for Cloud Foundry

When deploying to Cloud Foundry you can provide services
of the following types:

- `type: broker`
* `broker` - name of the CF broker
* `plan` - name of the plan
* `params` - additional parameters that will be converted to JSON
* `useExisting` - should use existing one or
create a new one (defaults to `false`)
- `type: app`
* `coordinates` - maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
* `manifestPath` - path to the manifest for the stub runner jar
- `type: cups`
* `params` - additional parameters that will be converted to JSON
- `type: cupsSyslog`
* `url` - URL to the syslog drain
- `type: cupsRoute`
* `url` - URL to the route service
- `type: stubrunner`
* `coordinates` - maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
* `manifestPath` - path to the manifest for the stub runner jar

== Opinionated implementation

For the demo purposes we're providing Docker Compose setup with Artifactory and Concourse / Jenkins tools.
Regardless of the picked CD application for the pipeline to pass one needs either

- a Cloud Foundry instance (for example https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services] or https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev[PCF Dev])
- a Kubernetes cluster (for example https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube])
- the infrastructure applications deployed to the JAR hosting application (for the demo we're providing Artifactory).
    - `Eureka` for Service Discovery
    - `Stub Runner Boot` for running Spring Cloud Contract stubs.

TIP: In the demos we're showing you how to first build the `github-webhook` project. That's because
the `github-analytics` needs the stubs of `github-webhook` to pass the tests. Below you'll find
references to `github-analytics` project since it contains more interesting pieces as far as testing
is concerned.

=== Build

image::{intro-root-docs}/build.png[title="Build and upload artifacts"]

In this step we're generating a version of the pipeline, next we're
 running unit, integration and contract tests. Finally we're:

- publishing a fat jar of the application
- publishing a Spring Cloud Contract jar containing stubs of the application
- for Kubernetes - uploading a Docker image of the application

During this phase we're executing a `Maven` build using Maven Wrapper or a `Gradle` build using Gradle Wrapper
, with unit and integration tests. We're also *tagging* the repository with `dev/${version}` format. That way in each
subsequent step of the pipeline we're able to retrieve the tagged version. Also we know
exactly which version of the pipeline corresponds to which Git hash.

Once the artifact got built we're running API compatibility check.

- we're searching for the latest production deployment
- we're retrieving the contracts that were used by that deployment
- from the contracts we're generating API tests to see if the current implementation
is fulfilling the HTTP / messaging contracts that the current production deployment
has defined (we're checking backward compatibility of the API)

=== Test

image::{intro-root-docs}/test.png[title="Smoke test and rollback test on test environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in PaaS
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS
- downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we're uploading it to PaaS. We want the application
to run in isolation (be surrounded by stubs).

TIP: Currently due to port constraints in Cloud Foundry
we cannot run multiple stubbed HTTP services in the cloud so to fix this issue we're running
the application with `smoke` Spring profile on which you can stub out all HTTP calls to return
a mocked response

- if the application is using a database then it gets upgraded at this point via Flyway, Liquibase
or any other tool once the application gets started
- from the project's Maven or Gradle build we're extracting `stubrunner.ids` property that contains
 all the `groupId:artifactId:version:classifier` notation of dependant projects for which
 the stubs should be downloaded.
- then we're uploading `Stub Runner Boot` and pass the extracted `stubrunner.ids` to it. That way
we'll have a running application in Cloud Foundry that will download all the necessary stubs
of our application
- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `smoke` profile. In the
case of `GitHub Analytics` application we're triggering a message from the `GitHub Webhook`
application's stub, that is sent via RabbitMQ to GitHub Analytics. Then we're checking if
message count has increased.
- once the tests pass we're searching for the last production release. Once the application
is deployed to production we're tagging it with `prod/${version}` tag. If there is no such tag
(there was no production release) there will be no rollback tests executed. If there was
a production release the tests will get executed.
- assuming that there was a production release we're checking out the code corresponding to that
release (we're checking out the tag), we're downloading the appropriate artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry
or Docker image for Kubernetes) and we're uploading
it to PaaS. *IMPORTANT* the _old_ artifact is running against the *NEW* version of the database.
- we're running the _old_ `smoke` tests against the freshly deployed application surrounded by stubs.
If those tests pass then we have a high probability that the application is backwards compatible
- the default behaviour is that after all of those steps the user can manually click to deploy the
application to a stage environment

=== Stage

image::{intro-root-docs}/stage.png[title="End to end tests on stage environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in PaaS
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS
- downloading the artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry or Docker image for Kubernetes)
from and we're uploading it to PaaS.

Next we have a manual step in which:

- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `e2e` profile. In the
case of `GitHub Analytics` application we're sending a HTTP message to GitHub Analytic's endpoint. Then we're checking if
the received message count has increased.

The step is manual by default due to the fact that stage environment is often shared between
teams and some preparations on databases / infrastructure have to take place before running the tests.
Ideally these step should be fully automatic.

=== Prod

image::{intro-root-docs}/prod.png[title="Deployment to production"]

The step to deploy to production is manual but ideally it should be automatic.

IMPORTANT: This step does deployment to production. On production you would assume
that you have the infrastructure running. That's why before you run this step you
must execute a script that will provision the services on the production environment.
For `Cloud Foundry` just call `tools/cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra` and
for Kubernetes `tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-prod-infra`

Here we're

- tagging the Git repo with `prod/${version}` tag
- downloading the application artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry or Docker image for Kubernetes)
- we're doing Blue Green deployment:
    - for Cloud Foundry
        * we're renaming the current instance of the app e.g. `fooService` to `fooService-venerable`
        * we're deploying the new instance of the app under the `fooService` name
        * now two instances of the same application are running on production
    - for Kubernetes
        * we're deploying a service with the name of the app e.g. `fooService`
        * we're doing a deployment with the name of the app with version suffix (with the name escaped
         to fulfill the DNS name requirements) e.g. `fooService-1-0-0-M1-123-456-VERSION`
        * all deployments of the same application have the same label `name` equal to app name e.g. `fooService`
        * the service is routing the traffic basing on the `name` label selector
        * now two instances of the same application are running on production
- in the `Complete switch over` which is a manual step
    * we're stopping the old instance
    * remember to run this step only after you have confirmed that both instances are working fine!
- in the `Rollback` which is a manual step
    * we're routing all the traffic to the old instance
    ** in CF we do that by ensuring that blue is running and removing green
    ** in K8S we do that by scaling the number of instances of green to 0
    * we're removing the latest prod git tag

== Project opinions

In this section we will go through the assumptions we've made in the project
structure and project properties.

=== Cloud Foundry project opinions

We've taken the following opinionated decisions for a Cloud Foundry based project:

- application built using Maven or Gradle wrappers

== Concourse Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS

[[concourse]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definition. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a
sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[concourse-pipeline-step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step by step

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<concourse-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
- <<concourse-start-cf,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<concourse-fly-cf,Setup the `fly` CLI>>
- <<concourse-credentials-cf,Setup your `credentials.yml`>>
- <<concourse-build-cf,Run the seed job>>
- <<concourse-run-cf,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[concourse-fork-cf]]
==== Fork repos

There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-cf]]
==== Start Concourse and Artifactory

Concourse + Artifactory can be run locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse
./setup_docker_compose.sh
./start.sh 192.168.99.100
----

The `setup_docker_compose.sh` script should be executed once only to allow
generation of keys.

The `192.168.99.100` param is an example of an external URL of Concourse
(equal to Docker-Machine ip in this example).

Then Concourse will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.

[[concourse-deploy-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[concourse-pcfdev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF Dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` to do this.

[[concourse-fly-cf]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

If you go to Concourse website you should see sth like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you've downloaded that (and maybe added to your PATH) you can run:

[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----

If `fly` is properly installed then it should print out the version.

[[concourse-credentials-cf]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

The repo comes with `credentials-sample-cf.yml` which is set up with sample data (most credentials) are set to be applicable for PCF Dev. Copy this file to a new file `credentials.yml` (the file is added to .gitignore so don't worry that you'll push it with your passwords) and edit it as you wish. For our demo just setup:

  - `app-url` - url pointing to your forked `github-webhook` repo
  - `github-private-key` - your private key to clone / tag GitHub repos
  - `repo-with-binaries` - the IP is set to the defaults for Docker Machine. You should update it to point to your setup

If you don't have a Docker Machine just execute `./whats_my_ip.sh` script to
get an external IP that you can pass to your `repo-with-binaries` instead of the default
Docker Machine IP.

Below you can see what environment variables are required by the scripts. To the right hand side you can see the default values for PCF Dev that we set in the `credentials-sample-cf.yml`.

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Property Name  | Property Description | Default value
|PAAS_TEST_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for TEST env| api.local.pcfdev.io
|PAAS_STAGE_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for STAGE env | api.local.pcfdev.io
|PAAS_PROD_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for PROD env | api.local.pcfdev.io
|PAAS_TEST_ORG    | Name of the org for the test env | pcfdev-org
|PAAS_TEST_SPACE_PREFIX  | Prefix of the name of the CF space for the test env to which the app name will be appended | sc-pipelines-test
|PAAS_STAGE_ORG   | Name of the org for the stage env | pcfdev-org
|PAAS_STAGE_SPACE | Name of the space for the stage env | sc-pipelines-stage
|PAAS_PROD_ORG   | Name of the org for the prod env | pcfdev-org
|PAAS_PROD_SPACE | Name of the space for the prod env | sc-pipelines-prod
|REPO_WITH_BINARIES_FOR_UPLOAD | URL to repo with the deployed jars | http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local
|M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID | The id of server from Maven settings.xml | artifactory-local
|PAAS_HOSTNAME_UUID | Additional suffix for the route. In a shared environment the default routes can be already taken |
|JAVA_BUILDPACK_URL | The URL to the Java buildpack to be used by CF | https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#v3.8.1 |
|BUILD_OPTIONS | Additional options you would like to pass to the Maven / Gradle build |
|======================

[[concourse-build-cf]]
==== Build the pipeline

Log in (e.g. for Concourse running at `192.168.99.100` - if you don't provide any value then `localhost` is assumed). If you execute this script  (it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it's in the same folder as the script is):

[source,bash]
----
./login.sh 192.168.99.100
----

Next run the command to create the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
./set_pipeline.sh
----

Then you'll create a `github-webhook` pipeline under the `docker` alias, using the provided `credentials.yml` file.
You can override these values in exactly that order (e.g. `./set-pipeline.sh some-project another-target some-other-credentials.yml`)

[[concourse-run-cf]]

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Concourse pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<concourse-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
- <<concourse-start-k8s,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s,Setup the `fly` CLI >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s,Setup your `credentials.yml` >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-build-k8s,Setup the pipeline >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-run-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork repos

[[concourse-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-k8s]]
=== Concourse in K8S (Kubernetes)

The simplest way to deploy Concourse to K8S is to use https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm].
Once you have Helm installed and your `kubectl` is pointing to the
cluster, just type this command to install the Concourse cluster in your K8S cluster.

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install stable/concourse --name concourse
----

Once it's done you'll see the following output

[source,bash]
----
1. Concourse can be accessed:

  * Within your cluster, at the following DNS name at port 8080:

    concourse-web.default.svc.cluster.local

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands in the same shell:

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080

2. Login with the following credentials

  Username: concourse
  Password: concourse
----

Just follow these steps and log in to Concourse under http://127.0.0.1:8080.

==== Deploying Artifactory to K8S

We can use Helm also to deploy Artifactory to K8S

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name artifactory --set artifactory.image.repository=docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss stable/artifactory
----

After executing this you'll see the following output

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory Pro!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc -w nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password
----

Next, we need to set up the repositories.

First, access the Artifactory URL and log in with
user, `admin` and `password` password.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_quick_setup.png[title="Click on the `Quick Setup`"]

Then, click on the Maven setup and click `Create`.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_maven_repo.png[title="Create the `Maven` Repository"]

[[concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

[[fly]] If you go to Concourse website you should see sth like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you've downloaded that (and maybe added to your PATH) you can run:

[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----

If `fly` is properly installed then it should print out the version.

[[concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

There is a sample credentials file called `credentials-sample-k8s.yml`
prepared for `k8s`. You can use it as a base for your `credentials.yml`.

To allow the Concourse worker's spawned container to connect to
Kubernetes cluster you will need to pass the CA contents and the
auth token.

To get the contents of CA for GCE just execute

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
----

To get the token just type:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
----

Set that value under `paas-test-client-token`, `paas-stage-client-token` and `paas-prod-client-token`

[[concourse-pipeline-build-k8s]]
==== Build the pipeline

After running Concourse you should get the following output in your terminal

[source,bash]
----
$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
$ echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse
----

Log in (e.g. for Concourse running at `127.0.0.1` - if you don't provide any value then `localhost` is assumed). If you execute this script  (it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it's in the same folder as the script is):

[source,bash]
----
$ fly -t k8s login -c http://localhost:8080 -u concourse -p concourse
----

Next run the command to create the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./set_pipeline.sh github-webhook k8s credentials-k8s.yml
----

[[concourse-faq]]
== Concourse FAQ

=== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! Just change the `app-url` in `credentials.yml`!

=== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions. Check out the documentation to see
what those decisions are.

=== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written in
Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash scripts without changing the
whole pipeline. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/tree/master/common/src/main/bash[You can check out the scripts here.]

Furthermore, if you only want to customize a particular function under `common/src/main/bash`, you can provide your own
function under `common/src/main/bash/<some custom identifier>` where `<some custom identifier>` is equal to the value of
the `CUSTOM_SCRIPT_IDENTIFIER` environment variable. It defaults to `custom`.

=== I ran out of resources!! (PCF Dev)

[[resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `./tools/cf-helper.sh kill-all-apps` that will remove
all demo-related apps deployed to PCF Dev.

=== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----

=== Can I see the output of a job from the terminal?

Yes! Assuming that pipeline name is `github-webhook` and job name is `build-and-upload` you can running

[source,bash]
----
fly watch --job github-webhook/build-and-upload -t docker
----

=== I clicked the job and it's constantly pending...

Don't worry... most likely you've just forgotten to click the `play` button to
unpause the pipeline. Click to the top left, expand the list of pipelines and click
the `play` button next to `github-webhook`.

Another problem that might occur is that you need to have the `version` branch.
Concourse will wait for the `version` branch to appear in your repo. So in order for
the pipeline to start ensure that when doing some git operations you haven't
forgotten to create / copy the `version` branch too.

=== The route is already in use (CF)

If you play around with Jenkins / Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied

[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io
Binding github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io to github-webhook...
FAILED
The route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io is already in use.
----

Just delete the routes

[source,bash]
----
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n stubrunner-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-prod
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-prod
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh delete-routes`

=== I'm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars

Most likely you've forgotten to update your local `settings.xml` with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml`>>.

=== `version` resource is broken

When I click on it it looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
resource script '/opt/resource/check []' failed: exit status 128

stderr:
Identity added: /tmp/git-resource-private-key (/tmp/git-resource-private-key)
Cloning into '/tmp/git-resource-repo-cache'...
warning: Could not find remote branch version to clone.
fatal: Remote branch version not found in upstream origin
----

That means that your repo doesn't have the `version` branch. Please
set it up.

In this section we will present the common setup of Jenkins for any platform.
We will also provide answers to most frequently asked questions.

----

In the `declarative-pipeline` you can find a definition of a `Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy` declarative
pipeline. It's used together with the Blueocean UI.

In the `jobs` folder you have all the seed jobs that will generate pipelines.

- `jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Pipeline plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample.groovy` - is an opinionated implementation using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample_view.groovy` - builds the views for the pipelines

In the `seed` folder you have the `init.groovy` file which is executed when Jenkins starts.
That way we can configure most of Jenkins options for you (adding credentials, JDK etc.).
`jenkins_pipeline.groovy` contains logic to build a seed job (that way you don't have to even click that
job - we generate it for you). Under the `k8s` folder there are all the configuration
files required for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

In the `src` folder you have production and test classes needed for you to build your own pipeline.
Currently we have tests only cause the whole logic resides in the `jenkins_pipeline_sample` file.

=== Optional customization steps

[[jenkins_optional]] All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[deploying-infra]]
==== Deploying infra jars to a different location

It's enough to set the `ARTIFACTORY_URL` environmental variable before
executing `tools/deploy-infra.sh`. Example for deploying to Artifactory at IP `192.168.99.100`

[[setup-settings-xml]]
==== Setup settings.xml for Maven deployment

TIP: If you want to use the default connection to the Docker version
of Artifactory you can skip this step

[[jenkins-settings]] So that `./mvnw deploy` works with Artifactory from Docker we're
already copying the missing `settings.xml` file for you. It looks more or less like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID}</id>
			<username>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_PASSWORD}</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>${DOCKER_SERVER_ID}</id>
			<username>${DOCKER_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${DOCKER_PASSWORD}</password>
			<configuration>
				<email>${DOCKER_EMAIL}</email>
			</configuration>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
----

As you can see the file is parameterized. In Maven it's enough to pass
to `./mvnw` command the proper system property to override that value. For example to pass
a different docker email you'd have to call `./mvnw -DDOCKER_EMAIL=foo@bar.com` and the value
gets updated.

If you want to use your own version of Artifactory / Nexus you have to update
the file (it's in `seed/settings.xml`).

[[setup-jenkins-env-vars]]
==== Setup Jenkins env vars

[[jenkins_env]] If you want to only play around with the demo that we've prepared you have to set *ONE* variable which is the `REPOS` variable.
That variable needs to consists of comma separated list of URLs to repositories containing business apps. So you should pass your forked repos URLs.

You can do it in the following ways:

- globally via Jenkins global env vars (then when you run the seed that variable will be taken into consideration and proper pipelines will get built)
- modify the seed job parameters (you'll have to modify the seed job configuration and change the `REPOS` property)
- provide the repos parameter when running the seed job

For the sake of simplicity let's go with the *last* option.

IMPORTANT: If you're choosing the global envs, you *HAVE* to remove the other approach
(e.g. if you set the global env for `REPOS`, please remove that property in the
seed job

[[setup-seed-props]]
===== Seed properties

Click on the seed job and pick `Build with parameters`. Then as presented in the screen below (you'll have far more properties to set) just modify the `REPOS` property by providing the comma separated list of URLs to your forks. Whatever you set will be parsed by the seed job and passed to the generated Jenkins jobs.

TIP: This is very useful when the repos you want to build differ. E.g. use
different JDK. Then some seeds can set the `JDK_VERSION` param to one version
of Java installation and the others to another one.

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed.png[]

In the screenshot we could parametrize the `REPOS` and `REPO_WITH_BINARIES` params.

[[global-envs]]
===== Global envs

IMPORTANT: This section is presented only for informational purposes - for the sake of demo you can skip it

You can add env vars (go to configure Jenkins -> Global Properties) for the following
 properties (example with defaults for PCF Dev):

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/env_vars.png[]

[[git-email]]
==== Set Git email / user

Since our pipeline is setting the git user / name explicitly for the build step
 you'd have to go to `Configure` of the build step and modify the Git name / email.
 If you want to set it globally you'll have to remove the section from the build
 step and follow these steps to set it globally.

You can set Git email / user globally like this:

[[jenkins-credentials-github]]
===== Add Jenkins credentials for GitHub

[[jenkins-credentials]] The scripts will need to access the credential in order to tag the repo.

You have to set credentials with id: `git`.

Below you can find instructions on how to set a credential (e.g. for Cloud Foundry `cf-test` credential but
remember to provide the one with id `git`).

=== Testing Jenkins scripts

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

=== How to work with Jenkins Job DSL plugin

Check out the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL[tutorial].
Provide the link to this repository in your Jenkins installation.

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).

=== Docker Image

If you would like to run the pre-configured Jenkins image somewhere other than your local machine, we
have an image you can pull and use on https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins/[DockerHub].
The `latest` tag corresponds to the latest snapshot build.  You can also find tags
corresponding to stable releases that you can use as well.

== Jenkins Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-cf,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-cf,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-cf,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-cf]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-cf]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-cf]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-cf]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

[[deploy-infra-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-cf]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[start-pcf-dev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-cf-resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins-pcfdev-cf]] You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF Dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-cf]]
==== Run the seed job

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on the *deploy previous version to stage* due to missing jar,
that means that you've forgotten to clear the tags in your repo. Typically that's due to the fact that
you've removed the Artifactory volume with deployed JAR whereas a tag in the repo is still pointing there.

IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting pipeline from specific stage, after failure. Please
check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33846[issue] for more information

WARNING: Currently there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins is
blocking an executor when manual step is required. That means that you'll run out of executors
pretty fast. You can check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[issue] for

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default we will
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline will be able
to push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built,
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images will be built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process will be reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That's why you don't have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster the driver
will not be shared by the Jenkins workers so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting pipeline from specific stage, after failure. Please
check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33846[issue] for more information

WARNING: Currently there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins is
blocking an executor when manual step is required. That means that you'll run out of executors
pretty fast. You can check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[issue] for

|======================

=== Preparing to connect to GCE

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using GCE

In order to use GCE we need to have `gcloud` running. If you already have the
CLI installed, skip this step. If not just execute to have the CLI
downloaded and an installer started

```bash
$ ./tools/k8s-helper.sh download-gcloud
```

Next, configure `gcloud`. Execute `gcloud init` and log in
to your cluster. You will get redirected to a login page, pick the
proper Google account and log in.

Pick an existing project or create a new one.

Go to your platform page (click on `Container Engine`) in GCP and connect to your cluster

```bash
$ CLUSTER_NAME=...
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ PROJECT_NAME=...
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_NAME}
$ kubectl proxy
```

The Kubernetes dashboard will be running at `http://localhost:8001/ui/`.

We'll need a Persistent Disk for our Jenkins installation. Let's create it

```bash
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ gcloud compute disks create --size=200GB --zone=${ZONE} sc-pipelines-jenkins-disk
```

Since the disk got created now we need to format it. You can check out
the instructions on how to do it here - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting

=== Connecting to a Kubo or GCE cluster

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using Kubo or GCE

In this section a description of steps required to deploy Jenkins and
Artifactory to a Kubernetes cluster deployed via Kubo.

TIP: To see the dashboard just do `kubectl proxy` and access `localhost:8081/ui`

- Log in to the cluster
- Deploy Jenkins and Artifactory to the cluster
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-vsphere` for a cluster deployed on VSphere
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-gce` for a cluster deployed to GCE
- Forward the ports so that you can access the Jenkins UI from your local machine

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=default
$ JENKINS_POD=jenkins-1430785859-nfhx4
$ LOCAL_PORT=32044
$ CONTAINER_PORT=8080
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} ${JENKINS_POD} ${LOCAL_PORT}:${CONTAINER_PORT}
```
- Go to `Credentials`, click `System` and `Global credentials`

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/kubo_credentials.png[caption="Click `Global credentials`"]

- Update `git`, `repo-with-binaries` and `docker-registry` credentials
- Run the `jenkins-pipeline-k8s-seed` seed job and fill it out with the following data
* Put `kubernetes.default:443` here (or `KUBERNETES_API:KUBERNETES_PORT`)
** `PAAS_TEST_API_URL`
** `PAAS_STAGE_API_URL`
** `PAAS_PROD_API_URL`
* Put `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` data here
** `PAAS_TEST_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CA_PATH`
* Uncheck the `Kubernetes Minikube` value
* Clear the following vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
* Set `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` value to these vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
* Set the cluster name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`
* Set the system name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_SYSTEM_NAME`
* Update the `DOCKER_EMAIL` property with your email
* Update the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_ORGANIZATION` with your Docker organization name
* If you don't want to upload the images to DockerHub update  `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`

== Jenkins FAQ

Below you can find the answers to most frequently asked questions.

[[jenkins_faq]]
=== Pipeline version contains ${PIPELINE_VERSION}

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----

To fix it you have to do exactly what the warning suggests... Also ensure that the `Groovy token macro processing`
checkbox is set.

=== Pipeline version is not passed to the build

You can see that the Jenkins version is properly set but in the build version is still snapshot and
the `echo "${PIPELINE_VERSION}"` doesn't print anything.

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----

To fix it you have to do exactly what the warning suggests...

=== The build times out with `pipeline.sh` info

Docker compose, docker compose, docker compose... The problem is that for some reason, only in Docker, the execution of
Java hangs. But it hangs randomly and only the first time you try to execute the pipeline.

The solution to this is to run the pipeline again. If once it suddenly, magically passes then
it will pass for any subsequent build.

Another thing that you can try is to run it with plain Docker. Maybe that will help.

=== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! you can pass `REPOS` variable with comma separated list of
`project_name$project_url` format. If you don't provide the PROJECT_NAME the
repo name will be extracted and used as the name of the project.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `github-analytics` and `github-webhook`.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`foo$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,bar$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/atom-feed`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `foo` for `github-analytics`
and `bar` for `github-webhook`.

=== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions like:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- For Maven:
    * usage of Maven Wrapper
    * artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
    * `stubrunner.ids` property to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded
    * running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
    * running end to end tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile
- For Gradle (in the `github-analytics` application check the `gradle/pipeline.gradle` file):
    * usage of Gradlew Wrapper
    * `deploy` task for artifacts deployment
    * running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` task
    * running end to end tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` task
    * `groupId` task to retrieve group id
    * `artifactId` task to retrieve artifact id
    * `currentVersion` task to retrieve the current version
    * `stubIds` task to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

=== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written
in Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash
scripts without changing the whole pipeline.

=== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

[[jenkins_tags]] You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----

=== I want to provide a different JDK version

- by default we assume that you have jdk with id `jdk8` configured
- if you want a different one just override `JDK_VERSION` env var and point to the proper one

TIP: The docker image comes in with Java installed at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
You can go to `Global Tools` and create a JDK with `jdk8` id and JAVA_HOME
 pointing to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`

To change the default one just follow these steps:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/global_tool.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Global Tool'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

And that's it!

[[groovy-token-macro]]
=== Enable Groovy Token Macro Processing

With scripted that but if you needed to this manually then this is how to do it:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/groovy_token.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click 'Allow token macro processing'"]

=== I want deployment to stage and prod be automatic

No problem, just set the property / env var to true

- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_STAGE` to automatically deploy to stage
- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` to automatically deploy to prod

=== I don't want to test API compativility

No problem, just set the `API_COMPATIBILITY_STEP_REQUIRED` env variable
to `false` and rerun the seed (you can pick it from the seed
job's properties too).

=== I can't tag the repo!

When you get sth like this:

[source,bash]
----
19:01:44 stderr: remote: Invalid username or password.
19:01:44 fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/github-webhook/'

----

most likely you've passed a wrong password. Check the <<jenkins_credentials,credentials>> section
on how to update your credentials.

=== I'm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars

Most likely you've forgotten to update your local `settings.xml` with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<jenkins_settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml`>>.

=== Signing Artifacts

In some cases it may be required that when performing a release that the artifacts be signed
before pushing them to the repository.
To do this you will need to import your GPG keys into the Docker image running Jenkins.
This can be done by placing a file called `public.key` containing your public key
and a file called `private.key` containing your private key in the `seed` directory.
These keys will be imported by the `init.groovy` script that is run when Jenkins starts.

=== Using SSH keys for git

The seed job checks if an env variable `GIT_USE_SSH_KEY` is set to `true`. If that's the case
then env variable `GIT_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID` will be chosen as the one that contains the
id of the credential that contains SSH private key. By default `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID` will be picked
as the one that contains username and password to connect to git.

You can set these values in the seed job by filling out the form / toggling a checkbox.

=== Deploy to stage fails and doesn't redeploy a service (Kubernetes)

There can be a number of reason but remember that for stage we
assume that a sequence of manual steps need to be performed. We don't
redeploy any existing services cause most likely you deliberately
have set it up in that way or the other. If in the logs of your application
you can see that you can't connect to a service, first ensure that
the service is forwarding traffic to a pod. Next if that's not the case
please delete the service and re-run the step in the pipeline. That way
Spring Cloud Pipelines will redeploy the service and the underlying pods.

=== I ran out of resources!! (Cloud Foundry)

[jenkins-cf-resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `./tools/cf-helper.sh kill-all-apps` that will remove all demo-related apps
deployed to PCF Dev.

=== Deploying to test / stage / prod fails - error finding space (Cloud Foundry)

If you receive a similar exception:

[source,bash]
----
20:26:18 API endpoint:   https://api.local.pcfdev.io (API version: 2.58.0)
20:26:18 User:           user
20:26:18 Org:            pcfdev-org
20:26:18 Space:          No space targeted, use 'cf target -s SPACE'
20:26:18 FAILED
20:26:18 Error finding space pcfdev-test
20:26:18 Space pcfdev-test not found
----

It means that you've forgotten to <<jenkins_pcfdev,create the spaces>> in your PCF Dev installation.

=== The route is already in use (Cloud Foundry)

If you play around with Jenkins / Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied

[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io
Binding github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io to github-webhook...
FAILED
The route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io is already in use.
----

Just delete the routes

[source,bash]
----
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n stubrunner-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-prod
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-prod
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh delete-routes`

=== How to execute helper scripts against a real CF instance I'm logged into (Cloud Foundry)

Assuming that you're already logged into the cluster it's enough to run the
helper script with the `REUSE_CF_LOGIN=true` env variable. Example:

```bash
REUSE_CF_LOGIN=true ./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra
```

This script will create the mysql db, rabbit mq service, download and deploy Eureka
to the space and organization you're logged into.
// remove::end[JENKINS]

// remove::start[K8S]
== Kubernetes setup

=== Kubernetes CLI Installation

First you'll need to install the `kubectl` CLI.

[[kubernetes-cli-script]]
==== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/k8s-helper.sh` script to install `kubectl`. Just call

```bash
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-kubectl
```

and then the `kubectl` will get downloaded

[[kubernetes-cli-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

Example for OSX

```bash
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Example for Linux

```bash
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Check out https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[this page] for more information.

[[start-minikube-k8s]]
=== Kubernetes Cluster setup

We need a cluster of Kubernetes. The best choice will be https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube].

TIP: You can skip this step if you have Kubernetes cluster installed and don't
want to use Minikube The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-resources-k8s,clear some apps from Minikube and continue>>.

[[kubernetes-minikube-script]]
==== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/k8s-helper.sh` script to install `Minikube`. Just call

```bash
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-minikube
```

and then the `Minikube` cluster will get downloaded

[[kubernetes-minikube-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

Example for OSX

```bash
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Feel free to leave off the `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you would like to add minikube to your path manually.

Example for Linux

```bash
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Feel free to leave off the `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you would like to add minikube to your path manually.
Check out https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases[this page] for more info on the installation.

=== Run Minikube

Just type in `minikube start` to start Kubernetes on your local box.

To add the dashboard just execute `minikube dashboard`

=== Certificates and Workers

==== Minikube Certificates and Workers

By default if you install Minikube all the certificates get installed in your
`~/.minikube` folder. Your `kubectl` configuration under `~/.kube/config` will also
get updated to use Minikube.

==== Manual Certificates and Workers Setup

IMPORTANT: If you just want to run the default, demo setup you can skip this section

To target a given Kubernetes instance one needs to pass around Certificate Authority
key and also user keys.

You can read more about the instructions on how to generate those keys https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/openssl.html[here].
 Generally speaking if you have a Kubernetes installation (e.g. `minikube`) this step
 has already been done for you. Time to reuse those keys on the workers.

Extracted from the https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/configure-kubectl.html[official docs].

Configure kubectl to connect to the target cluster using the following commands, replacing several values as indicated:

- Replace `${MASTER_HOST}` with the master node address or name used in previous steps
- Replace `${CA_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `ca.pem` created in previous steps
- Replace `${ADMIN_KEY}` with the absolute path to the `admin-key.pem` created in previous steps
- Replace `${ADMIN_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `admin.pem` created in previous steps

```
$ kubectl config set-cluster default-cluster --server=https://${MASTER_HOST} --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-credentials default-admin --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT} --client-key=${ADMIN_KEY} --client-certificate=${ADMIN_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-context default-system --cluster=default-cluster --user=default-admin
$ kubectl config use-context default-system
```

=== Generate Minikube namespaces

With the running Minikube cluster we need to generate namespaces. Just execute the
`./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-namespaces` to do this.
// remove::end[K8S]

// remove::start[CF]
== The demo setup (Cloud Foundry)

The demo uses 2 applications. https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook/[Github Webhook]
and https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github analytics code]. Below you can
see an image of how these application communicate with each other.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo.png[caption="The overview of the demo: ", title="Github Webhook listens to HTTP calls and sends a message to Github Analytics"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

For the demo scenario we have two applications. `Github Analytics` and `Github Webhook`.
Let's imagine a case where Github is emitting events via HTTP. `Github Webhook` has
an API that could register to such hooks and receive those messages. Once this happens
 `Github Webhook` sends a message by RabbitMQ to a channel. `Github Analytics` is
 listening to those messages and stores them in a MySQL database.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo_metrics.png[caption="Gathering metrics: ", title="Github Analytics exposes metrics that are polled by Prometheus"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

`Github Analytics` has its KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) monitored. In the case
of that application the KPI is number of issues.

Let's assume that if we go below the threshold of X issues then an alert should be
sent to Slack.

=== Deploying production applications to PCF Dev

In the real world scenario we wouldn't want to automatically provision services like
RabbitMQ, MySQL or Eureka each time we deploy a new application to production. Typically
production is provisioned manually (using automated solutions). In our case, before
you deploy to production you can provision the `pcfdev-prod` space using the
 `cf-helper.sh`. Just call

[source,bash]
----
$ ./cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra
----

What will happen is that the CF CLI will login to PCF Dev, target `pcfdev-prod` space,
setup RabbitMQ (under `rabbitmq-github` name), MySQL (under `mysql-github-analytics` name)
and Eureka (under `github-eureka` name).

=== Running Prometheus on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/prometheus-on-PCF[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Go to https://prometheus.io/download/ and download linux binary. Then call:

```
cf push sc-pipelines-prometheus -b binary_buildpack -c './prometheus -web.listen-address=:8080' -m 64m
```

Also `localhost:9090` in `prometheus.yml` should be `localhost:8080`.

The file should look like this to work with the demo setup (change `github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io`
to your `github-analytics` installation).

```yml
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']

  - job_name: 'demo-app'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io']
```

A deployed version for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo is available https://sc-pipelines-prometheus.cfapps.io/[here]

=== Running Grafana on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/cf-grafana[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Download tarball from https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=linux
Next set `http_port = 8080` in `conf/default.ini`. Then call

```
cf push sc-pipelines-grafana -b binary_buildpack -c './bin/grafana-server web' -m 64m
```

The demo is using Grafana Dashboard with ID `2471`.

Next, let's create the prometheus installation with the predefined values.

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name sc-pipelines-prometheus stable/prometheus -f values.yaml
----

Then you should see the following output

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
The Prometheus server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the Prometheus server URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9090


The Prometheus alertmanager can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-alertmanager.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the Alertmanager URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=alertmanager" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9093


The Prometheus PushGateway can be accessed via port 9091 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-pushgateway.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the PushGateway URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=pushgateway" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9093

For more information on running Prometheus, visit:

=== Running Grafana on Kubernetes

Use Helm to install Grafana

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name sc-pipelines-grafana stable/grafana
----

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
1. Get your 'admin' user password by running:

   kubectl get secret --namespace default sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.grafana-admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo

2. The Grafana server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:

   sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana.default.svc.cluster.local

   Get the Grafana URL to visit by running these commands in the same shell:

     export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana,component=grafana" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
     kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 3000

3. Login with the password from step 1 and the username: admin
----

Perform the aforementioned steps and add the Grafana's datasource
as Prometheus with URL `http://sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local`

You can pick the dashboard via the Grafana ID (2471). This is the
default dashboard for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo apps.

If you have both apps (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics`) running on production
we can now trigger the messages. Download the JSON with a sample request
from https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/github-webhook-kubernetes/blob/master/src/test/resources/github-webhook-input/hook-created.json[the github-webhook repository].
Next, pick one of the `github-webhook` pods and forward its port
locally to a port `9876` like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=sc-pipelines-prod $( kubectl get pods --namespace=sc-pipelines-prod | grep github-webhook | head -1 | awk '{print $1}' ) 9876:8080
----

next send a couple of requests (more than 4).

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:9876/ -d @path/to/issue-created.json \
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
----

Then if you check out Grafana you'll see that you went above the
threshold.

== Step by step Cloud Foundry migration

check out the slides by https://twitter.com/ciberkleid[Cora Iberkleid] where she
migrates a setup of applications to be compliant with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

// remove::end[CF]

== Building the project

=== Prerequisites

As prerequisites you need to have http://www.shellcheck.net/[shellcheck],
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats[bats], https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]
 and https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[ruby] installed. If you're on a Linux
 machine then `bats` and `shellcheck` will be installed for you.

To install the required software on Linux just type the following commands

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y ruby jq
----

If you're on a Mac then just execute these commands to install the missing software

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install jq
$ brew install ruby
$ brew install bats
$ brew install shellcheck
----

=== Bats submodules

To make `bats` work properly we needed to attach Git submodules. To have them
initialized either clone with appropriate command

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
----

or if you have already cloned the project and are just pulling changes

[source,bash]
----
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
----

If you forget about this step, then Gradle will execute these steps for you.

=== Build and test

Once you have installed all the prerequisites you can execute

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew clean build
----

to build and test the project.

=== Generate docs

To generate docs just run

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew generateDocs
----

=== Making a release

It's enough to execute the `release` task that will automatically
change the versions, build the docs, upload them to Spring Cloud Static,
tag the repo and then revert the changed versions back to default.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew release -PnewVersion=1.0.0.RELEASE
----

== Customizing the project

If you want to pick only pieces (e.g. you're interested only in `Cloud Foundry` with
`Concourse` combination) it's enough to execute this command:

```bash
$ ./gradlew customize
```

You'll see a screen looking more or less like this:

```bash
:customize
  ___          _              ___ _             _   ___ _           _ _
 / __|_ __ _ _(_)_ _  __ _   / __| |___ _  _ __| | | _ (_)_ __  ___| (_)_ _  ___ ___
 \__ \ '_ \ '_| | ' \/ _` | | (__| / _ \ || / _` | |  _/ | '_ \/ -_) | | ' \/ -_|_-<
 |___/ .__/_| |_|_||_\__, |  \___|_\___/\_,_\__,_| |_| |_| .__/\___|_|_|_||_\___/__/
     |_|             |___/                               |_|



Follow the instructions presented in the console or terminate the process to quit (ctrl + c)


=== PAAS TYPE ===
Which PAAS type do you want to use? Options: [CF, K8S, BOTH]
<-------------> 0% EXECUTING
> :customize
```

Now you need to answer a couple of questions. That way whole files and its pieces
will get removed / updated accordingly. If you provide `CF` and `Concourse` options
thn `Kubernetes` and `Jenkins` configuration / folders / pieces of code in
the project will get removed.

== Releasing the project

=== Publishing A Docker Image

When doing a release you also need to push a Docker image to Dockerhub.
From the project root, run the following commands replacing `<version>` with the
version of the release.

[source,bash]
----
docker login
docker build -t springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version> ./jenkins
docker push springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version>
----
