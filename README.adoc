== How to build it

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

The seed job for Spring Cloud should scan the `jobs/springcloud/*.groovy` files.

Remember to add `src/main/groovy` and `src/main/resources` for processing

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).
