= Spring Cloud Pipelines

Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud are tools that let developers speed up the
time of creating new business features. It is common knowledge, however, that the
feature is only valuable if it is in production. That is why companies
spend a lot of time and resources on building their own deployment pipelines.

This project tries to solve the following problems:

* Creation of a common deployment pipeline.
* Propagation of good testing and deployment practices.
* Reducing the time required to deploy a feature to production.

A common way of running, configuring, and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.

== Introduction

This section describes the rationale
behind the opinionated pipeline. We go through each deployment
step and describe it in detail.

IMPORTANT: You do not need to use all the pieces of Spring Cloud Pipelines. You
can (and should) gradually migrate your applications to use those pieces of
Spring Cloud Pipelines that you think best suit your needs.

=== Five-second Introduction

Spring Cloud Pipelines provides scripts, configuration, and convention for automated
deployment pipeline creation for Jenkins and Concourse with Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes.
We support JVM languages, PHP, and NodeJS. Since SC-Pipelines uses bash scripts,
you can use it with whatever automation server you have.

=== Five-minute Introduction

Spring Cloud Pipelines comes with bash scripts (available under `common/src/main/bash`)
that represent the logic of all steps in our opinionated deployment pipeline.
Since we believe in convention over configuration, for the supported framework and
languages, we assume that the projects follow certain conventions of task naming,
profile setting, and so on. That way, if you create a new application,
your application can follow those conventions and the deployment pipeline works.
Since no one pipeline can serve the purposes of all
teams in a company, we believe that minor deployment pipeline tweaking should take place.
That is why we allow the usage of that `sc-pipelines.yml` descriptor, which allows for
provide some customization.

From the pipeline visualization perspective, we have prepared templates for Concourse
and Jenkins (through the Jenkins Job DSL and Jenkinsfile). That means you can reuse them
immediately to visualize a deployment pipeline. If you use some other tool for
continuous delivery, you can set the visualization yourself and reference the
bash scripts for each step. In other words, Spring Cloud Pipelines can be reused
with any continuous delivery tool.

==== How to Use It

This repository can be treated as a template for your pipeline. We provide some opinionated
implementation that you can alter to suit your needs. To use it, we recommend downloading
the Spring Cloud Pipelines repository as a zip file, unzipping it in a directory,
initializing a Git project in that directory, and then modifying the project to suit your
needs. The following bash script shows how to do so:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ # pass the branch (e.g. master) or a particular tag (e.g. v1.0.0.RELEASE)
$ SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE=...
$ curl -LOk https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/archive/${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ unzip ${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ cd spring-cloud-pipelines-${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}
$ git init
$ # modify the pipelines to suit your needs
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin ${YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL}
$ git push origin master
----
====

To keep your repository aligned with the changes in the upstream repository, you can also
clone the repository. To not have many merge conflicts, we recommend using the `custom`
folder hooks to override functions.

==== How It Works

As the following image shows, Spring Cloud Pipelines contains logic to generate a
pipeline and the runtime to execute pipeline steps.

image::{intro-root-docs}/how.png[title="How Spring Cloud Pipelines works"]

Once a pipeline is created (for example, by using the Jenkins Job DSL or from a Concourse
templated pipeline), when the jobs are ran, they clone or download Spring Cloud Pipelines
code to run each step. Those steps run functions that are
defined in the `commons` module of Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Spring Cloud Pipelines performs steps to guess what kind of a project your
repository is (for example, JVM or PHP) and what framework it uses (Maven or Gradle), and it
can deploy your application to a cloud (Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes). You can read about how
it works by reading the <<how-do-the-scripts-work>> section.

All of that happens automatically if your application follows the conventions.
You can read about them in the <<project-opinions>> section.

==== Supported Languages

Currently, we support the following languages:

* JVM
** Maven wrapper-based project
** Gradle wrapper-based project
* PHP
** Composer-based project
* NPM

==== Centralized Pipeline Creation

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines to generate pipelines
for all the projects in your system. You can scan all your
repositories (for example, you can call the Stash or Github API to retrieve the list of repositories)
and then:

* For Jenkins, call the seed job and pass the `REPOS`
parameter, which contains the list of repositories.
* For Concourse, call `fly` and set the
pipeline for every repository.

TIP: We recommend using Spring Cloud Pipelines this way.

==== A Pipeline for Each Repository

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines in such a way that
each project contains its own pipeline definition in
its code. Spring Cloud Pipelines clones the code with
the pipeline definitions (the bash scripts), so the
only piece of logic that needs to be in your application's
repository is the pipeline definition.

For Jenkins, you need to either set up the `Jenkinsfile`
or the jobs by using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin in your repo.
Then, in Jenkins, whenever you set up a new pipeline for a repository,
you can reference the pipeline definition in that repo.
For Concourse, each project contains its own pipeline steps,
and it is up to the project to set up the pipeline.

=== The Flow

The following images show the flow of the opinionated pipeline:

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow_concourse.png[title="Flow in Concourse"]

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow.png[title="Flow in Jenkins"]

We first describe the overall concept behind the flow and then
split it into pieces and describe each piece independently.

===Vocabulary

This section defines some common vocabulary. We describe four typical
environments in terms of running the pipeline.

==== Environments

We typically encounter the following environments:

* *build* environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It is a continuous integration or continuous delivery tool worker.
* *test* is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It does not
resemble production, because we cannot be sure of its state (which application is deployed
there and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.
* *stage* is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely, applications
are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
Typically, staging databases hold (often obfuscated) production data. Most
often, this environment is a single environment shared between many teams. In other
words, in order to run some performance and user acceptance tests, you have to block
and wait until the environment is free.
* *prod* is the production environment where we want our tested applications to be
deployed for our customers.

==== Tests

We typically encounter the following kinds of tests:

* *Unit tests*: Tests that run on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases or HTTP server stubs or other resources take place.
Generally speaking, your application should have plenty of these tests to provide fast
feedback about whether your features work.

* *Integration tests*: Tests that run on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in-memory databases and HTTP server stubs take place. According to the
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html[test pyramid], in most cases, you should
not have many of these kind of tests.

* *Smoke tests*: Tests that run on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check that the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain the most money from five features, you could write smoke tests
for those five features. We are talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.

* *End-to-end tests*: Tests that run on a system composed of multiple applications.
These tests ensure that the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, and resources to maintain such an environment
and that these tests are often unreliable (due to many different moving pieces, such as network,
database, and others), you should have a handful of those tests. They should be only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
do not even want to have these tests and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting, you can quickly react when your deployed application
does not behave properly.

* *Performance testing*: Tests run on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle a big load. In the case of our opinionated pipeline,
these tests can run either on test (against a stubbed environment) or on
staging (against the whole system).

==== Testing against Stubs

Before we go into the details of the flow, consider the example described by the following image:

image::{intro-root-docs}/monolith.png[title="Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing"]

When you have only a handful of applications, end-to-end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective, it is maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective, it is nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.

In the case of microservices, the scale starts to be a problem, as the following image shows:

image::{intro-root-docs}/many_microservices.png[title="Many microservices deployed in different versions"]

The following questions arise:

* Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?
** If I queue deployments, people have to wait for hours to have their tests run. That can be a problem
* To remove that issue, I can have an environment for each microservice.
** Who will pay the bills? (Imagine 100 microservices, each having each own environment).
** Who will support each of those environments?
** Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
them up and running for the whole day?
* In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?
** If I have development versions, I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
That can lead to exceptions in production.
** If I test against production versions, I can never test against a feature under development
anytime before deployment to production.

One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to not do end-to-end tests.

The following image shows one solution to the problem, in the form of stubbed dependencies:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies"]

If we stub out all the dependencies of our application, most of the problems presented earlier
disappear. There is no need to start and setup the infrastructure required by the dependent
microservices. That way, the testing setup looks like the following image:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="We're testing microservices in isolation"]

Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract]):

* No need to deploy dependent services.
* The stubs used for the tests run on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests.
* Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (see http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract] for more information).
* We do not have many slow tests running on a deployed application, so the pipeline gets executed much faster.
* We do not have to queue deployments. We test in isolation so that pipelines do not interfere with each other.
* We do not have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes.

However, this approach brings the following challenges:

* No end-to-end tests before production. You do not have full certainty that a feature is working.
* The first time the applications interact in a real way is on production.

As with every solution, it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
lets you configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.

==== General View

The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:

* Test the application in isolation.
* Test the backwards compatibility of the application, in order to roll it back if necessary.
* Allow testing of the packaged application in a deployed environment.
* Allow user acceptance tests and performance tests in a deployed environment.
* Allow deployment to production.

The pipeline could have been split to more steps, but it seems that all of the aforementioned
actions fit nicely in our opinionated proposal.

=== Pipeline Descriptor

Each application can contain a file (called `sc-pipelines.yml`) with the following structure:

====
[source,yaml]
----
language_type: jvm
pipeline:
	# used for multi module projects
	main_module: things/thing
	# used for multi projects
	project_names:
		- monoRepoA
		- monoRepoB
	# should deploy to stage automatically and run e2e tests
	auto_stage: true
	# should deploy to production automatically
	auto_prod: true
	# should the api compatibility check be there
	api_compatibility_step: true
	# should the test rollback step be there
	rollback_step: true
	# should the stage step be there
	stage_step: true
	# should the test step (including rollback) be there
	test_step: true
lowercaseEnvironmentName1:
	# used by spinnaker
	deployment_strategy: HIGHlANDER
	# list of services to be deployed
	services:
		- type: service1Type
		  name: service1Name
		  coordinates: value
		- type: service2Type
		  name: service2Name
		  key: value
lowercaseEnvironmentName2:
	# used by spinnaker
	deployment_strategy: HIGHlANDER
	# list of services to be deployed
	services:
		- type: service3Type
		  name: service3Name
		  coordinates: value
		- type: service4Type
		  name: service4Name
		  key: value
----
====

If you have a multi-module project, you should point to the folder that contains the
module that produces the fat jar. In the preceding example, that module
would be present under the `things/thing` folder. If you have a single module project,
you need not create this section.

For a given environment, we declare a list of infrastructure services that we
want to have deployed. Services have:

* `type` (examples: `eureka`, `mysql`, `rabbitmq`, and `stubrunner`): This value gets
then applied to the `deployService` Bash function
* *[KUBERNETES]*: For `mysql`, you can pass the database name in the `database` property.
* `name`: The name of the service to get deployed.
* `coordinates`: The coordinates that let you fetch the binary of the service.
It can be a Maven coordinate (`groupid:artifactid:version`),
a docker image (`organization/nameOfImage`), and so on.
* Arbitrary key value pairs, which let you customize the services as you wish.

==== Pipeline Descriptor for Cloud Foundry

When deploying to Cloud Foundry you can provide services
of the following types:

* `type: broker`
** `broker`: The name of the CF broker
** `plan`: The name of the plan
** `params`: Additional parameters are converted to JSON
** `useExisting`: Whether to use an existing one or
create a new one (defaults to `false`)
* `type: app`
** `coordinates`: The Maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
** `manifestPath`: The path to the manifest for the stub runner jar
* `type: cups`
** `params`: Additional parameters are converted to JSON
* `type: cupsSyslog`
** `url`: The URL to the syslog drain
* `type: cupsRoute`
** `url`: The URL to the route service
* `type: stubrunner`
** `coordinates`: The Maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
** `manifestPath`: The path to the manifest for the stub runner jar

The following example shows the contents of a YAML file that defines the preceding values:

====
[source,yaml]
----
# This file describes which services are required by this application
# in order for the smoke tests on the TEST environment and end to end tests
# on the STAGE environment to pass

# lowercase name of the environment
test:
  # list of required services
  services:
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: stubrunner
      type: stubrunner
      coordinates: io.pivotal:cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot:0.0.1.M1
      manifestPath: sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml

stage:
  services:
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
----
====

Another CF specific property is `artifact_type`. Its value can be either `binary` or `source`.
Certain languages (such as Java) require a binary to be uploaded, but others (such as PHP)
require you to push the sources. The default value is `binary`.

=== Project Setup

Spring Cloud Pipelines supports three main types of project setup:

* `Single Project`
* `Multi Module`
* `Multi Project` (also known as mono repo)

A `Single Project` is a project that contains a single module that gets
built and packaged into a single, executable artifact.

A `Multi Module` project is a project that contains multiple modules.
After building all modules, one gets packaged into a single, executable artifact.
You have to point to that module in your pipeline descriptor.

A `Multi Project` is a project that contains multiple projects. Each of those
projects can in turn be a `Single Project` or a `Multi Module` project. Spring
Cloud Pipelines assume that, if a `PROJECT_NAME` environment
variable corresponds to a folder with the same name in the root of the
repository, this is the project it should build. For example, for
`PROJECT_NAME=something`, if there's a folder named `something`, then Spring Cloud Pipelines
treats the `something` directory as the root of the `something` project.

```

Before we run the script, we need to answer a few questions related to your repository:

* What is your language (for example, `jvm`,`php`, or something else)?
* what framework do you use (for example, `maven` or `gradle`)?
* what PAAS do you use (for example, `cf` or `k8s`)?


The following sequence diagram (created via https://textart.io/sequence[textart.io]) describes how the sourcing of bash scripts takes place:

The process works as follows:

. A script (for example, `build_and_upload.sh`) is called.
. It sources the `pipeline.sh` script that contains all the essential function "`interfaces`" and
environment variables.
. `pipeline.sh` needs information about the project type. It
sources `projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh`.
. `projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh` contains logic to determine the language.
.. Verify whether a repository contains files that correspond to the given languages (for example, `mvnw` or `composer.json`).
.. Verify whether a concrete framework that we support (for example, `maven` or `gradle`) is present.
. Once we know what the project type is, we can deal with PAAS. Depending on the value of the `PAAS_TYPE` environment
variable, we can source proper PAAS functions (for example, `pipeline-cf.sh` for Cloud Foundry).
. Determine whether we can do some further customization.
.. Search for a file called `${sc-pipelines-root}/common/src/main/bash/custom/build_and_upload.sh`
to override any functions you want.
. Run the `build` function from `build_and_upload.sh`

[[project-crawler]]
=== Project Crawler

In Jenkins, you can generate the deployment pipelines by passing an environment variable
with a comma-separated list of repositories. This, however, does not scale. We would like to automatically fetch
a list of all repositories from a given organization and team.

To do so, we use the https://github.com/spring-cloud/project-crawler[Project Crawler]
library, which can:

* Fetch all projects for a given organization.
* Fetch contents of a file for a given repository.

Thanks to the Project Crawler, you can run the seed job, and ,automatically, all the new repositories
are picked and pipelines are created for them. Project Crawler supports repositories
stored at Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket. You can also register your own implementation. See the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/project-crawler[Project Crawler] repository for more information.

=== How Scripts Work with Spinnaker

With Spinnaker, the deployment pipeline is inside of Spinnaker. No longer do we treat
Jenkins or Concourse as a tool that does deployments. In Jenkins, we create only
the CI jobs (that is, build and test) and prepare the JSON definitions of Spinnaker pipelines.

The following diagram shows how Jenkins, the seed job for Spinnaker, and Spinnaker cooperate:

== Opinionated Implementation

This section describes a full flow of the demo applications.

IMPORTANT: Your applications need not have the same dependencies (such as `Eureka`) as this demo.

For demo purposes, we provide Docker Compose setup with Artifactory, Concourse, and Jenkins tools.
Regardless of the CD application, for the pipeline to pass, you need one of the following:

* A Cloud Foundry instance (for example, https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services] or https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev[PCF Dev]).
* A Kubernetes cluster (for example, https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]).
* The infrastructure applications deployed to the JAR hosting application (for the demo, we provide Artifactory).
* `Eureka` for Service Discovery.
* `Stub Runner Boot` for running Spring Cloud Contract stubs.

TIP: In the demos, we show you how to first build the `github-webhook` project. That is because
the `github-analytics` needs the stubs of `github-webhook` to pass the tests. We also use
references to the `github-analytics` project, since it contains more interesting pieces as far as testing
is concerned.

=== Build

The following image shows the results of building the demo pipeline (which the rest of this chapter describes):

image::{intro-root-docs}/build.png[title="Build and upload artifacts"]

In this step, we  generate a version of the pipeline. Next, we
run unit, integration, and contract tests. Finally, we:

* Publish a fat jar of the application.
* Publish a Spring Cloud Contract jar containing stubs of the application.
* For Kubernetes, upload a Docker image of the application.

During this phase, we run a `Maven` build by using Maven Wrapper or a `Gradle` build by using Gradle Wrapper,
with unit and integration tests. We also tag the repository with `dev/${version}`. That way, in each
subsequent step of the pipeline, we can retrieve the tagged version. Also, we know
exactly which version of the pipeline corresponds to which Git hash.

Once the artifact is built, we run API compatibility check, as follows:

* We search for the latest production deployment.
* We retrieve the contracts that were used by that deployment.
* From the contracts, we generat API tests to see if the current implementation
is fulfilling the HTTP and messaging contracts that the current production deployment
has defined (we check backward compatibility of the API).

=== Test

The following image shows the result of doing smoke tests and rolling back:

image::{intro-root-docs}/test.png[title="Smoke test and rollback test on test environment"]

Here, we:

* Start a RabbitMQ service in PaaS.
* Deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS.
* Download the fat jar from Nexus and upload it to PaaS. We want the application
to run in isolation (be surrounded by stubs).

TIP: Currently, due to port constraints in Cloud Foundry,
we cannot run multiple stubbed HTTP services in the cloud. To fix this issue, we run
the application with the `smoke` Spring profile, on which you can stub out all HTTP calls to return
a mocked response.

* If the application uses a database, it gets upgraded at this point by Flyway, Liquibase,
or any other migration tool once the application gets started.
* From the project's Maven or Gradle build, we extract the `stubrunner.ids` property that contains
all the `groupId:artifactId:version:classifier` notations of dependent projects for which
the stubs should be downloaded.
* We upload `Stub Runner Boot` and pass the extracted `stubrunner.ids` to it. That way,
we have a running application in Cloud Foundry that downloads all the necessary stubs
of our application.
* From the checked-out code, we run the tests available under the `smoke` profile. In the
case of the `GitHub Analytics` application, we trigger a message from the `GitHub Webhook`
application's stub and send the message by RabbitMQ to GitHub Analytics. Then we check whether the
message count has increased.
* Once the tests pass, we search for the last production release. Once the application
is deployed to production, we tag it with `prod/${version}`. If there is no such tag
(there was no production release), no rollback tests are run. If there was
a production release, the tests get executed.
* Assuming that there was a production release, we check out the code that corresponds to that
release (we check out the tag), download the appropriate artifact (either a JAR for Cloud Foundry
or a Docker image for Kubernetes), and we upload
it to PaaS.

IMPORTANT: The old artifact runs against the *NEW* version of the database.

We run the old `smoke` tests against the freshly deployed application, surrounded by stubs.
If those tests pass, we have a high probability that the application is backwards compatible.
* The default behavior is that, after all of those steps, the user can manually click to deploy the
application to a stage environment.

=== Stage

The following image shows the result of deploying to a stage environment:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stage.png[title="End to end tests on stage environment"]

Here, we:

* Start a RabbitMQ service in PaaS.
* Deploy `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS.
* Download the artifact (either a JAR for Cloud Foundry or a Docker image for Kubernetes)
upload it to PaaS.

Next, we have a manual step in which, from the checked-out code, we run the tests available under the `e2e` profile. In the
case of the `GitHub Analytics` application, we send an HTTP message to the GitHub Analytics endpoint. Then we check whether
the received message count has increased.

By default, this step is manual, because the stage environment is often shared between
teams and some preparations on databases and infrastructure have to take place before the tests can be run.
Ideally, these step should be fully automatic.

=== Prod

The following image shows the result of deploying to a production environment:

image::{intro-root-docs}/prod.png[title="Deployment to production"]

The step to deploy to production is manual. However, ideally, it should be automatic.

IMPORTANT: This step does deployment to production. On production, we assume
that you have the infrastructure running. That is why, before you run this step, you
must run a script that provisions the services on the production environment.
For `Cloud Foundry`, call `tools/cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra`.
For Kubernetes, call `tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-prod-infra`.

Here, we:

* Tag the Git repo with `prod/${version}`.
* Download the application artifact (either a JAR for Cloud Foundry or a Docker image for Kubernetes).
* We do Blue Green deployment:
** For Cloud Foundry:
*** We rename the current instance of the application (for example, `myService` to `myService-venerable`).
*** We deploy the new instance of the app under the `fooService` name
*** Now, two instances of the same application are running on production.
** For Kubernetes:
*** We deploy a service with the name of the application (for example, `myService`)
*** We do a deployment with the name of the application with version suffix,with the name escaped
to fulfill the DNS name requirements (for example, `fooService-1-0-0-M1-123-456-VERSION`).
*** All deployments of the same application have the same label `name`, which is equal to the application name (for example, `myService`).
*** The service routes the traffic by basing on the `name` label selector.
*** Now two instances of the same application are running in production.
* In the `Complete switch over`, which is a manual step, we stop the old instance.
+
NOTE: Remember to run this step only after you have confirmed that both instances work.
+
* In the `Rollback`, which is a manual step,
** We route all the traffic to the old instance.
*** In CF, we do that by ensuring that blue is running and removing green.
*** In K8S, we do that by scaling the number of instances of green to 0.
** We remov the latest prod Git tag.

== Customizing the Project

Spring Cloud Pipelines offers a number of ways to customize a Pipelines project:

* <<customization-overriding-scripts>>
* <<customization-overriding-pipelines>>
* <<customization-picking-features>>

[[customization-overriding-scripts]]
=== Overriding Scripts

Since Spring Cloud Pipelines evolves, you may want to pull the most recent changes to your
Spring Cloud Pipelines fork. To not have merge conflicts, the best approach
to extending the functionality is to use a separate script with customizations.

When we execute a script that represents a step (for example, a script named `build_and_upload.sh`),
after we source all the deployment and build-specific scripts (such as `pipeline-cf.sh`
and `projectType/pipeline-jvm.sh` with `projectType/pipeline-gradle.sh`), we set
a hook that lets you customize the behavior. If the script that we run
is `common/src/main/bash/build_and_upload.sh`, we search for a script in the
Spring Cloud Pipelines repository under `common/src/main/bash/custom/build_and_upload.sh`,
and we source that script just before running any functions.

The following example shows such a customization:

.custom/build_and_upload.sh
====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

function build() {
    echo "I am executing a custom build function"
}

export -f build
----
====

when the `build` function is called for our Gradle project, instead of
calling the Gradle build process, we echo the following text: `I am executing a custom build function`.

[[customization-overriding-pipelines]]
=== Overriding Pipelines

Currently, the best way to extend the Concourse and Jenkins Jenkinsfile pipelines is to make
a copy of the Concourse pipeline `yaml` files and the Jenkins seed and pipeline jobs.

==== Overriding Jenkins Job DSL pipelines

We provide an interface (called `org.springframework.cloud.pipelines.common.JobCustomizer`)
that lets you provide customization for:

* all jobs
* build jobs
* test jobs
* stage jobs
* prod jobs

We use the JDK's `java.util.ServiceLoader` mechanism to achieve extensibility.

You can write an implementation of that interface (for example, `com.example.MyJubCustomizer`)
and create a `META-INF/org.springframework.cloud.pipelines.common.JobCustomizer` file in which you put the
`com.example.MyJubCustomizer` line.

If you create a JAR with your class (for example `com.example:my-customizer:1.0.0`),
put it on the build classpath, as the following example shows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    // ...
    libs "com.example:my-customizer:1.0.0"
    // ...
}
----
====

If you do not want to create a separate library, you can create an implementation in the
sources under `src/main/resources/META-INF`.

Regardless of what you chose, your implementation runs for each job. You can add notifications
or any other customizations of your choosing.

[[customization-picking-features]]
=== Picking Features

If you want to pick only pieces (for example you want only `Cloud Foundry` combined with
`Concourse`), you can run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew customize
----
====

A screen resembling the following appears:

====
[source,bash]
----
:customize
  ___          _              ___ _             _   ___ _           _ _

====

Now you need to answer a couple of questions. Depending on your choices, whole files and their pieces
get removed and updated accordingly. For example, if you choose the `CF` and `Concourse` options,
the `Kubernetes` and `Jenkins` configuration and folders and pieces of code in
the project get removed.

== Step-by-step Cloud Foundry Migration

This section details how to migrate applications such that they become compatible with  Spring Cloud Pipelines.

=== Preview

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSsEHn8cJfz8oWIwwUhdULt7nZzz3bBLK7OqM8UInkZ0LbQBCpPdhMoxsYGPe_90h9OvCu7dFlAimMJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000[Click here] to
check out the slides by https://twitter.com/ciberkleid[Cora Iberkleid] where she
migrates a set of applications to be compliant with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

=== Introduction

This tutorial covers refactoring applications to be compatible with, and take advantage of, Spring Cloud Pipelines.

As an example, we use a simple three-tier application, shown in the following image:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_logical.png[title="Use Case - Logical View"]

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to quickly create a Concourse pipeline for each application and run successfully through a full lifecycle, from source code commit to production deployment, following the lifecycle stages for testing and deployment recommended by Spring Cloud Pipelines. You will be able to improve application code bases with organized test coverage, a contract-based API, and a versioned database schema, letting Spring Cloud Pipelines carry out stubbed testing and ensure backward compatibility for API and database schema changes.

=== Sample Application -- Initial State

The sample application is implemented by using Spring Boot applications for the UI and service tiers and MySQL for the database.

The apps are built with Maven and manually pushed to Cloud Foundry. They leverage the three Pivotal Spring Cloud Services: Config Server, Service Discovery, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard. We use Rabbit to propagate Config Server refresh triggers.

The source code for the two Spring Boot applications is stored on GitHub, as is the backing repo for Config Server.

The following image shows an implementation view of the applications and their ancillary services:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_implementation.png[title="Use Case - Implementation"]

=== Sample Application -- End State

Throughout this tutorial, we add Concourse and JFrog Bintray to manage the application lifecycle.

We also refactor the applications so that they become compatible with Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements and recommendations, including adding and organizing tests and introducing database versioning by using Flyway and introducing API contracts by using Spring Cloud Contract.

=== Tutorial -- Toolset

Throughout this tutorial, we use the following tools:

* *GitHub*: Sample application source code and configuration repositories, a sample stubrunner application repository, and the Spring Cloud Pipelines code base, including the following:
** https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[`greeting-ui`]
** https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[`fortune-service`]
** https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[`app-confi`g]
** https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[`cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`]
** https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines[`spring-cloud-pipelines`]
* *Pivotal Web Services*: Publicly hosted Cloud Foundry offering http://run.pivotal.io[free trial accounts] and including MySQL, Rabbit, and Pivotal Spring Cloud Services in the Marketplace
* *Concourse*
* *JFrog Bintray*: Publicly hosted Maven repository offering free https://bintray.com/signup/oss[OSS accounts]
* *Client Tools*: On your local machine, you need an IDE as well as the mvn, git, cf, and fly (Concourse) CLIs

=== Tutorial -- Overview

We separate the migration steps into three stages:

. *Scaffolding*
** Minimal refactoring to be compatible with basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements.
** At the end of this stage, each application has a corresponding pipeline on Concourse. The pipelines successfully build the applications, store the artifacts in Bintray, tag the GitHub repositories, and deploy the applications to the Test, Stage, and Prod spaces in Cloud Foundry.
. *Tests*
** Add and organize tests to be compatible with Spring Cloud Pipelines recommendations.
** Incorporate flyway for database schema versioning and initial data loading.
** At the end of this stage, the pipelines trigger unit and integration tests during the Build stage, smoke tests in the Test environment, and end-to-end tests in the Stage environment. The pipelines also ensure backward compatibility for the database, such that you can safely roll back the backend service application, even after the database schema has been updated.
. *Contracts*
** Incorporate Spring Cloud Contract to define the API between the UI and service apps and auto-generate tests and stubs.
** At the end of this stage, the pipelines catch breaking API changes during the Build stage and ensure backward compatibility for the API, such that you can safely roll back the backend service (producer) app, even after an API change.

=== Tutorial -- Step-by-step

The remainder of this chapter is the actual tutorial, which consists of a preparation stage and three main stages:

* <<tutorial-prep>>
* <<tutorial-stage-one>>
* <<tutorial-stage-two>>
* <<tutorial-stage-three>>

[[tutorial-prep]]
==== Prep: Before you begin

If you want to simply review the migration steps explained below, you can look at the various branches in the https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui] and https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service] repositories. A branch represents the end-state of each stage, as the following image shows:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/github_branches.png[title="GitHub Branches"]

If you want to use this tutorial as a hands-on lab, fork each of the following repositories:

* https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui]
* https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service]
* https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config]

Then create a new directory on your local machine. You may name it anything you like. We refer to it as `$SCP_HOME` throughout this tutorial.

In `$SCP_HOME`, clone your forks of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, as well as the following two repositories:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines[spring-cloud-pipelines]

Finally, create a directory called `$SCP_HOME/credentials`. Leave it empty for now.

[[tutorial-stage-one]]
==== Stage One: Scaffolding

In this stage, we make minimal changes to satisfy basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements so that the applications can run through the entire pipeline without error. We make "`scaffolding`" changes only -- no code changes.

IMPORTANT: You must complete the steps in this stage for both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`.

===== 1.1 Create GitHub Branches

Create branches in GitHub by using the following git commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
git branch version
git checkout -b sc-pipelines
----
====
The `version` branch is required to exist, though it can be created as an empty branch. It is used by Spring Coud Pipelines to generate a version number for each new pipeline execution.

The `sc-pipelines` branch is optional and can be named anything you wish. The intention is for you to use it as a working branch for the changes suggested in this tutorial (hence, you should both create it and check it out).

===== 1.2 Add Maven Wrapper

This step covers how to add the Maven wrapper (which lets your users build without having Maven on the path). To add the Maven wrapper, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
----
====

This commands adds four files to a project:

====
[source]
----
.
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
└── .mvn
    └── wrapper
        ├── maven-wrapper.jar
        └── maven-wrapper.properties
----
====

Make sure all four files are tracked by Git. One way to do so is to add the following lines to the `.gitignore` file:

====
[source]
----
#Exceptions
!/mvnw
!/mvnw.cmd
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
----
====

===== 1.3 Create the Bintray Maven Repository Package

We use Bintray as the Maven repository. Bintray requires that a package exist before any application artifacts can be uploaded.

Log into the Bintray UI and create the packages as follows (you can use the "`Import from GitHub`" option to create these):

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/bintray_packages.png[title="Bintray Packages"]

===== 1.4 Configure Distribution Management by Using the Bintray Maven Repository

IMPORTANT: You must do this step for both application repositories.

Edit the application `pom.xml` files. Make sure that the Bintray URLs match the URLs of the corresponding packages created in the previous step. The values you use should differ from the following example in that they should point to your repository:

====
[source,xml]
----
<properties>
...
<distribution.management.release.id>bintray</distribution.management.release.id>
<distribution.management.release.url>https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service</distribution.management.release.url>
</properties>

...

<distributionManagement>
<repository>
<id>${distribution.management.release.id}</id>
<url>${distribution.management.release.url}</url>
</repository>
</distributionManagement>
----
====

Though not required by Spring Cloud Pipelines, it makes sense to also configure your local maven settings with the credentials to your Bintray maven repository. To do so, edit your maven settings file (usually `~/.m2/settings.xml`). If the file does not exist, create it.

Note that the `id` must match the `id` specified in the previous step. Also, make sure to use your username and API token (not your account password) instead of the sample values shown in the following example:

====
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>bintray</id>
      <username>ciberkleid</username>
      <password>my-super-secret-api-token</password>
   </server>
 </servers>
</settings>
----
====

===== 1.5 Push Changes to GitHub

Push the changes you made in the preceding step to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two application repositories:

* Four new Maven wrapper files
* A modified `.gitignore` file
* A modified `pom.xml` file

===== 1.6 Add a Spring Cloud Pipelines Credentials File

In `$SCP_HOME/credentials`, make two copies of the `$SCP_HOME/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/credentials-sample-cf.yml` file. Rename them as `credentials-fortune-service.yml` and `credentials-greeting-ui.yml`.

CAUTION: These files will contain credentials to your GitHub repository, your Bintray repository, and your Cloud Foundry foundation. Hence, we opt to put them in a separate directory. You may choose to store these files in a private Git repository, but do not push them to a public repository.

Edit the Git properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown in our example. For `tools-branch`, you can use a fixed release (use v1.0.0.M8 or later for Cloud Foundry). Leave the other values as they are. We update those in later steps. The following listing shows a credentials file:

====
[source,yml]
----
app-url: git@github.com:ciberkleid/fortune-service.git
app-branch: sc-pipelines
tools-scripts-url: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
tools-branch: master
build-options: ""

github-private-key: |

  ...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
git-email: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
git-name: Cora Iberkleid
----
====

Edit the Maven repository properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown in our example. Bintray requires separate URLs for uploads and downloads. If you use a different artifact repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus, and the repository URL is the same for uploads and downloads, you do not need to set `repo-with-binaries-for-upload`. The following listing shows the values to add or edit in your credentials file:

====
[source,yml]
----
m2-settings-repo-id: bintray
m2-settings-repo-username: ciberkleid
m2-settings-repo-password: my-super-secret-api-token

repo-with-binaries: https://ciberkleid:my-super-secret-api-token@dl.bintray.com/ciberkleid/maven-repo

repo-with-binaries-for-upload: https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service
----
====

===== 1.7 Set the Concourse Pipeline

At this point, all of the build jobs, which run on Concourse workers, should succeed.

To verify this, log in to your Concourse target and set the Concourse pipelines. Update the target name in the following example:

====
[source,bash]
----
# Set greeting-ui pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p greeting-ui -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-greeting-ui.yml" -n

# Set fortune-service pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p fortune-service -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-fortune-service.yml" -n
----
====

Log into the Concourse UI and un-pause the pipelines. Start each pipeline. You should see that the build jobs all succeed, similar to the following image:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_build_success.png[title="Build Success"]

In addition, you should see a new `dev/<version_number>` tag in each GitHub repository and see the app jars uploaded into Bintray.

The test, stage, and prod jobs fail, because we have not yet added scaffolding for deployment to Cloud Foundry. We do that next.

===== 1.8 Add Cloud Foundry manifest

If you are deploying to Cloud Foundry, you may already be routinely including manifest files with your applications. Our sample applications did not have manifest files, so we add them now.

In the `greeting-ui` repository, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: greeting-ui
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

In the `fortune-service` repository, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

The `TRUST_CERTS` variable is used by the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services (Config Server, Service Registry, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard), which we use in this example. The value specified in the preceding example assumes deployment to Pivotal Web Services. Update it accordingly if you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, or you can leave it out altogether if you are replacing the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services with alternative implementations (for example, deploying the services as applications and exposing them as user-provided services).

If you wishi, you can add additional values to the manifest files -- for example, if additional values are useful for any manual deployment you may still want to do or if you need additional values in your Spring Cloud Pipelines deployment. For example, the following file could be an alternative `manifest.yml` for `fortune-service`:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  instances: 3
  memory: 1024M
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
  random-route: true
  path: ./target/fortune-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: someProfile
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

Note that Spring Cloud Pipelines ignores `random-route` and `path`. `instances` is honored in stage and prod but is overridden with a value of 1 for test.

===== 1.9 Add the Spring Cloud Pipelines Manifest

The Cloud Foundry manifest created in the previous step includes the logical names of the services to which the applications should be bound, but it does not describe how the services can be provisioned. Hence, we add a second manifest file so that Spring Cloud Pipelines can provision the services.

Add a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` to each application and include the same list of services as in the corresponding `manifest.yml`. Add the necessary details such that Spring Cloud Pipelines can construct a `cf create-service` command.

NOTE: The `type: broker' parameter in the next example instructs Spring Cloud Pipelines to provision a service by using `cf create-service'. Other service types are also supported: cups, syslog, route, app, and stubrunner.

More specifically, for `greeting-ui`, create an `sc-pipelines.yml` file with the following content:

====
[source,yml]
----
test:
  services:
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
----
====

The `sc-pipelines.yml` file for `fortune-service` is similar, with the addition of the `fortune-db` service, as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
test:
  # list of required services
  services:
    - name: fortune-db
      type: broker
      broker: cleardb
      plan: spark
      useExisting: true
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
----
====

The values in the preceding two examples assume deployment to Pivotal Web Services. If you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, update the values accordingly. Also, make sure to replace the `config-server` URI with the address of your fork of the https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[`app-config`] repository.

TIP: Notice the `useExisting: true` parameter in the preceding example. By default, Spring Cloud Pipelines deletes and re-creates services in the `test` space. To override this behavior and re-use existing services, we set `useExisting: true`. This is helpful in cases where services  may take time to provision and initialize, where there is no risk in re-using them between pipeline runs, or where it is desirable to retain the service instance from the last pipeline run (for example, a database migration).

===== 1.10 Push changes to GitHub

Push the preceding changes to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two application repositories:

* A new app manifest file
* A new sc-pipelines manifest file

===== 1.11 Create Cloud Foundry Orgs and Spaces

Spring Cloud Pipelines requires that the Cloud Foundry test, stage, and prod spaces exist before a pipeline is run. If you wish, you can use different foundations, orgs, and users for each. For simplicity, in this example, we use a single foundation (PWS), a single org, and a single user.


You can name the orgs and spaces anything you like. Each app requires its own test space. The stage and prod spaces are shared.

For this example, use the following commands to create spaces:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf create-space scp-test-greeting-ui
cf create-space scp-test-fortune-service
cf create-space scp-stage
cf create-space scp-prod
----
====

===== 1.12 Create Cloud Foundry Stage and Prod Service Instances

Spring Cloud Pipelines dynamically creates the services in the test spaces, as defined by the `sc-pipelines.yml` file we created previously. Optionally, you can add a second section to the `sc-pipelines.yml` file for the stage environment, and these are created dynamically as well. However, you must always crate prod manually.

For this example, we create both the stage and prod services manually.

Create the services listed in the application manifest files in both `scp-stage` and `scp-prod`.

===== 1.13 Update the Spring Cloud Pipelines Credentials File

Update the `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` credentials files with Cloud Foundry information. Replace values in the next example as appropriate for your Cloud Foundry environment.

Notice that the test space name specified is a prefix, unlike the stage and prod space names, which are literals. Spring Cloud Pipelines append the application name to the test space name, thereby matching the test space names we created manually. The stage and prod space names are not prefixes and are not altered by Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Note also the `paas-hostname-uuid`. The value is included in each created route. This value is optional, but it is useful in shared or multi-tenant environments (such as PWS), as it helps to ensure routes are unique. Change it to a unique uuid.

The following example shows an updated credentials file:

====
[source,yml]
----
pipeline-descriptor: sc-pipelines.yml

paas-type: cf

paas-hostname-uuid: cyi

===== 1.14 Update the Concourse Pipeline with Updated Credentials Files

Set the Concourse pipelines again, as we did previously, to update them with the values added to the credentials files. The test, stage, and prod jobs should all now succeed and result in output similar to the following image:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_test_stage_prod_success.png[title="Test, Stage, & Prod Success"]

On Cloud Foundry, you should now see the apps deployed in the test, stage, and prod spaces. The following image shows the deployment of `fortune-service` to its dedicated test space:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/cf_test_and_prod_deployed.png[title="Cloud Foundry Test and Prod Deployment"]

Notice that the five services declared in its manifest files (`sc-pipelines.yml` for provisioning and `manifest.yml` for binding) have also been automatically provisioned. The image also shows the deployment of the same app to the shared prod space. Notice that the instance of the previous version has been renamed as `venerable` and stopped. If a rollback were deemed necessary, the `prod-rollback` job in the pipeline could be triggered to remove the currently running version, remove the `prod/<version_number>` tag from GitHub, and re-start the former (`venerable`) version.

===== Stage One Recap and Next Steps

What have we accomplished?

* By adding the basic scaffolding needed to enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to manage the lifecycle of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` from source code commit to production deploy, we have made it possible for the application development teams to instantly and easily create pipelines for each application by using a common, standardized template.
* We can count on the pipelines to:
** Automatically provision services in test spaces and, optionally, in stage spaces as well.
** Dynamically clean up the test spaces between pipeline executions.
** Upload the app artifacts to the maven repo (for example, Bintray).
** Tag the git repositories with `dev/<version_number>` and `prod/<version_number>`.
* After each successful pipeline run, we can, if necessary, to roll back to the last deployed version byusing the `prod-rollback` job.

These accomplishments are extremely valuable. However, to derive confidence and reliability from the pipelines, we need to incorporate testing. We do this in Stage Two of the application migration.

[[tutorial-stage-two]]
==== Stage Two: Tests

In this stage, we enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to execute tests so that we can increase confidence in the code being deployed. We do so by adding test profiles to the `pom.xml` files and then organizing or adding tests in a way that corresponds to the profiles. By doing so, we establish standards around testing across development teams in the enterprise.

We will also enable database schema versioning in this stage, thereby providing the foundation for rollback testing during schema changes.

===== 2.1 Add Maven Profiles

For both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, add a `profiles` section to the `pom.xml` file, as shown in the next listing. Note that we are adding four profiles:

* `default`
** For unit and integration tests. Note that this profile includes all tests except those that are explicitly called by the smoke and e2e profiles.
** Tests matching this profile run during the build-and-upload job.
* `apicompatibility`
** For ensuring backward compatibility in case of API changes. Note that this is not effective until Stage Three, when we will add contracts. However, we add this profile now to ensure the api compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job does not run other tests.
* `smoke`
** For tests to be run against the application deployed in the test space.
* `e2e`
** For tests to be run against the application deployed in the stage space.

The following listing shows the necessary `profiles` element of a `pom.xml` file:

====

===== 2.2 Add and Organize Tests

Next, we ensure that we have a matching test package structure in our apps, as the following image shows:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/test_package_structure.png[title="Test Package Structure"]

Note that we are creating matching packages only for the default, smoke, and e2e profiles. We will address the package for the `apicompatibility` profile in Stage Three.

When working with your own applications, if you have existing tests, you would move the files into one of these packages now and rename them so that they are included by the filters declared in the profiles (that is, the file names end in `Test.java` or `Tests.java`)

In the case of our sample apps, we have no tests, so we add some now.

====== `fortune-service` Default Tests

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile, as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These are run on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application that runs on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we add two tests, one that loads the context and another that verifies the number of rows expected in the database. The following example defines these tests:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = FortuneServiceApplication.class)
public class FortuneServiceApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate template;

    @Test
    public void testDefaultSettings() throws Exception {
        assertThat(this.template.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) from FORTUNE",
                Integer.class)).isEqualTo(7);
    }

}
----
====

====== `fortune-service` Smoke Tests

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile, as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-fortune-service` space. Two versions of these tests are executed against the application:

* the current version, in the `test-smoke` job.
* the latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_smoke_tests.png[title="fortune-service Smoke Tests"]

In the test environment, we choose to verify that `fortune-service` is retrieving a fortune from `fortune-db`, and not returning its Hystrix fallback response. The following example defines this test:

====
[source,java]
----
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
----
====

====== `fortune-service` End-to-end (`e2e`) Tests

Add your end-to-end tests so that they match the `e2e` profile, as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These tests run on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `greeting-ui` is also present.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_e2e_tests.png[title="fortune-service E2E Tests"]

In the `e2e` environment, we choose to use a string replacement to obtain the URL for `greeting-ui`. We also choose to verify that we hit `fortune-db` and do not receive Hystrix fallback responses from either application. The following example shows this test:

====
[source,java]
----
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

	// The app is running in CF but the tests are executed from Concourse worker,
	// so the test will deduce the url to greeting-ui: it will assume the same host
	// as fortune-service, and simply replace "fortune-service" with "greeting-ui" in the url

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl.replace("fortune-service", "greeting-ui") + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback responses from both fortune and greeting
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.").doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
----
====

====== `greeting-ui` Default Tests

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile, as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application that runs on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we add one test that loads the context:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class)
public class GreetingUIApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

}
----
====

====== `greeting-ui` Smoke Tests

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile, as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-greeting-ui` space. Two versions of these tests run against the app:

* The current version, in the `test-smoke` job.
* The latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_smoke_tests.png[title="greeting-ui Smoke Tests"]

Since `fortune-service` is not deployed to the `scp-test-greeting-ui` space, we expect to receive the Hystrix fallback response defined in `greeting-ui`. Hence, our smoke test validates that condition:

====
[source,java]
----
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

    @Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void should_return_a_fallback_fortune() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
                .getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

        BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

        // Expect the hystrix fallback response
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).contains("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
    }

}
----
====

====== `greeting-ui` End-to-end (`e2e`) Tests

Add your end-to-end tests so that they match the `e2e` profile, as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `fortune-service` is also present.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_e2e_tests.png[title="greeting-ui E2E Tests"]

In the `e2e` environment, we choose to verify that we hit `fortune-service` and do not receive the Hystrix fallback response from `greeting-ui`. The following example shows the test:

====
[source,java]
----
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
	}

}
----
====

===== 2.3 Enable Database Versioning

At this point, we also incorporate https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway], an OSS database migration tool, to track database schema versions and handle schema changes and data loading.

This change needs to be made only to `fortune-service`, since `fortune-service` owns the interaction with `fortune-db`.

====== Add Flyway Dependency

We first add the Flyway dependency to the `fortune-service` `pom.xml`. We need not add a version as Spring Boot takes care of that for us. The following listing shows the Flyway dependency:

====
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
      <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
----
====

====== Create Flyway Migration

Next, we create a migration directory and our initial migration file, following Flyway's file naming convention. The following image shows the name of the file in context:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_file_name.png[title="fortune-service Flyway File Name"]

Note that the filename specifies the version (`V1`), followed by two underscore characters.

We place our `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements in our `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql` file, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE fortune (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  text varchar(255) not null
);

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do what works.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do the right thing.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Always be kind.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You can always find happiness at work on Friday.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You will be hungry again in one hour.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Today will be an awesome day!');
----
====

====== Disable JPA DDL Initialization

Because we rely on Flyway to create and populate the schema, we need to disable JPA-based database initialization. We can set `ddl-auto` to `validate`, which validates the schema against the application entities and throws an error in case of a mismatch but does not actually generate the schema. The following snippet shows how to do so:

====
[source,yml]
----
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
----
====

There are a few options for where to store the `ddl-auto` configuration, both in terms of location (in the `fortune-service` app or on the `app-config` GitHub repo) and in terms of file name. For this example, update the `application.yml` in the `fortune-service` app for local testing. Additionally, save these values in a new file called `application-flyway.yml` on your fork of https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[`app-config`].

By convention, `fortune-service` picks up the configurations in `application-flyway.yml` if the string `flyway` is in the list of active Spring profiles. Consequently, we can add `flyway` to the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable in the `fortune-service` `manifest.yml`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: flyway
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

====== Remove Non-Flyway Data Loading

We can now remove the old code that populated the database. In our sample app, this was found in the `io.pivotal.FortuneServiceApplication` class. The following listing shows the code we now remove:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
    CommandLineRunner loadDatabase(FortuneRepository fortuneRepo) {
        return args -> {
//            logger.debug("loading database..");
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(1L, "Do what works."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(2L, "Do the right thing."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(3L, "Always be kind."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(4L, "You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(5L, "You can always find happiness at work on Friday."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(6L, "You will be hungry again in one hour."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(7L, "Today will be an awesome day!"));
            logger.debug("record count: {}", fortuneRepo.count());
            fortuneRepo.findAll().forEach(x -> logger.debug(x.toString()));
        };

    }
----
====

We also no longer need the `Fortune` entity constructors, so we can comment these out in the `io.pivotal.fortune.Fortune` class as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
//    public Fortune() {
//    }
//
//    public Fortune(Long id, String text) {
//        super();
//        this.id = id;
//        this.text = text;
//    }
----
====

====== Flyway Integration Summary

With that, we have completed the setup for Flyway, and our database schema is now versioned. From this point onward, Spring Boot calls `Flyway.migrate()` to perform the database migration. As long as we follow Flyway conventions for future schema changes, Flyway takes care of tracking the schema version and migrating the database for us.

From a rollback perspective, Spring Cloud Pipelines includes two jobs in the `test` phase (`test-rollback-deploy` and `test-rollback-smoke`), wherein it validates that the latest prod jar works against the newly updated database. The purpose is to ensure that we can roll back the application in prod if a problem is discovered after the prod database schema has been updated and avoid the burden of rolling back the database.

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html#howto-use-a-higher-level-database-migration-tool[Spring Boot database initialization with Flyway] for further information, including Flyway configuration options.

===== 2.4 Push Changes to GitHub

For `greeting-ui`, you should push the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/GreetingUIApplicationTests.java`
* `src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java`


For `fortune-service`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplicationTests.java`
* `src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java`
* `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql`
* `src/main/resources/application.yml`
* `manifest.yml`
* `src/main/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplication.java`
* `src/main/java/io/pivotal/fortune/Fortune.java`

For `app-config`, you should be pushing the following new:

* `application-flyway.yml`


===== 2.5 Re-run the Pipelines

Run through the pipelines again and view the output for the jobs that run the default, smoke, and end-to-end (`e2e`) tests. You should see that the tests we added in this stage were run.

As you run through the pipelines a second time, you should see the smoke tests from the latest prod version run against the database in the `test-rollback-smoke` job. In this case, there is no schema upgrade. Nonetheless, the tests confirm that the latest prod version of the app can be used with the current database schema.

You can see the database version information stored in the database by Flyway either by querying the database itself or by hitting the flyway endpoint on the `fortune-service` URL. The following image shows an example from the `scp-stage` environment:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_schema_info.png[title="fortune-service Flyway Schema Info"]

===== Stage Two Recap and Next Steps

What have we accomplished?

* Increased the effectiveness of the pipelines and our confidence in them by integrating our applications with the testing strategy built into Spring Cloud Pipelines.
* Established a standard approach to organizing tests, which brings consistency within and across development teams.
* Enabled auto-managed database versioning and backward compatibility testing that alleviates database schema management throughout the release management lifecycle.

We can now add any unit, integration, smoke, and end-to-end tests to our code base and have a high level of reliability and confidence in our pipelines. We are also better positioned to ensure that our development teams conform to these practices, given the structure established by Spring Cloud Pipelines and the fast feedback and visibility we gain from the pipelines as they execute the tests.

However, we could benefit further by incorporating contracts to define and test the API integration points between applications. We do this in Stage Three of the application migration.

[[tutorial-stage-three]]
==== Stage Three: Contracts

In this stage, we introduce contract-based programming practices into our sample application. Doing so improves API management capabilities, including defining, communicating, and testing API semantics. It also lets us catch breaking API changes (that is, we can validate API backward compatibility) in the build phase. This extends the effectiveness of the pipelines, encourages better communication and programming practices across development teams, and provides faster feedback to developers.

We will integrate Spring Cloud Contract and add contracts, stubs, and a stub runner. We will also now complete and make use of the `apicompatibility` profile defined in <<tutorial-stage-two>>.

===== 3.1 Create a Contract

We start by creating the contract for the interaction between `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`. The contract should describe the following expectation: `greeting-ui` makes a `GET` request to the root URL of `fortune-service` and expects a response with status 200 and a string (`new fortune`) in the body

We code this buy using groovy syntax as follows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description("""
should return a fortune string
""")
    request {
        method GET()
        url "/"
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body "new fortune"
    }
}
----
====

Save this contract in the `fortune-service` code base in the following location (which is compliant with Spring Cloud Contract convention): `src/test/resources/contracts/<service-name>/<contract-file>`. The following image shows the contract file in its location within an IDE:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_contract_file.png[title="fortune-service Flyway Contract File"]

[NOTE]
=====
You can optionally enable your IDE to assist with contract syntax by adding the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to your `pom.xml` file. It is pluggable, and includes groovy and pact by default. The following element shows the dependency to add:

====
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
----
====
=====

===== 3.2 Create a Base Class for Contract Tests

Now that we have a coded contract, we want to enable auto-generation of contract-based tests. The auto-generation, which we will configure in the next steps, requires a base class that stubs out the service that satisfies the API call, so that we can run the test without external dependencies (for example, the database). The objective is to focus on testing API semantics.

We create the base class in the `fortune-service` test package as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.fortune;

import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.mockito.BDDMockito;

public class BaseClass {

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        FortuneService service = BDDMockito.mock(FortuneService.class);
        BDDMockito.given(service.getFortune()).willReturn("foo fortune");
        RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new FortuneController(service));
    }
}
----
====

===== 3.3 Enable Automated Contract-based Testing

Now that we have a contract and a base class, we can use the Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin to auto-generate contract tests, stubs, and a stub jar.

First we add the Spring Cloud Contract version to the list of properties in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file, since we will reference it when we enable the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin. To do so, we add the `<spring-cloud-contract.version>` to the `properties` element, as follows:

====
[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
...
    <spring-cloud-contract.version>1.2.1.RELEASE</spring-cloud-contract.version>
...
</properties>
----
====

Next, we edit the `default` profile in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file to:

* Add a plugin block for Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin.
* Configure it to use our base class (`io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass`) to generate tests.
* Configure it to place auto-generated tests in the `io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests` test package.

Note that the package of the contract tests is included by the `include` filter in the `default` profile, so these tests run against the application during the `build-and-upload` job. For `fortune-service`, this serves to validate that the application conforms to the contract.

The following listing shows the complete profile:

====
[source,xml]
----
    <profile>
      <id>default</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>

              <baseClassForTests>io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass</baseClassForTests>
              <basePackageForTests>io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests</basePackageForTests>
            </configuration>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
----
====

When the app is built, the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin also now produces a stub and a stub jar that contains the contract and stub. This stub jar is uploaded to Bintray, along with the usual app jar. As we see shortly, this stub jar can be used by the `greeting-ui` development team while they wait for `fortune-service` to be completed. In other words, this gives the `greeting-ui` development team a producer to test against that is based on a mutually agreed-upon contract without the lead time of having to wait for `fortune-service` team to implement anything more than a base class and without having to manually stub out calls to `fortune-service` based on arbitrary or static responses.

TIP: Package the project locally (run `mvn package`) to observe the tests, stubs, and stub jar that the Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin generates. See the following image for reference:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_generated_tests.png[title="Generated Tests and Stubs"]

===== 3.4 Enable backward compatibility API check

To enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to catch any breaking API changes during the the API compatibility check in the `build-and-upload` job, we add the Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin to the `apicompatibility` profile as well.

In this case, we want the plugin to generate tests based on contracts outside of the project (the ones from the latest prod version), so we configure the plugin to download the latest prod stub jar, which contains the old contract. The plugin uses the old contract and the specified base class (which, in our example, is the same as the one in the previous step) to generate contract tests. These tests are run against the new code to validate that it is still compatible with consumers that comply with the prior contract. This ensures backward compatibility for the API.

In short, we edit the `apicompatibility` profile in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file to:

* Add a plugin block for Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin.
* Configure it to download the latest prod stub jar from Bintray to obtain the old contract.
* Configure it to use our base class (`io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass`) to generate tests (we use the same one as in the prior step).
* Configure it to place auto-generated tests in the `io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests` test package.

Note that the package of the contract tests matches the `include` filter in the `apicompatibility` profile, so these tests run against the app during the the API compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job. For `fortune-service`, this serves to validate that the app conforms to the old contract.

The following listing shows the complete profile:

====

----
====

Spring Cloud Pipelines dynamically injects the values for `${repo.with.binaries}` and `${latest.production.version}`. You can run this locally by providing these values manually as system properties in the Maven command.

===== 3.5 Push Changes to GitHub

All changes in Stage Three thus far are in `fortune-service`. At this point, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/test/resources/contracts/greeting-ui/shouldReturnAFortune.groovy`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/fortune/BaseClass.java`

===== 3.6 Re-run the `fortune-service` Pipeline

Run through the `fortune-service` pipeline to generate stubs. The following output from the `build-and-upload` job shows the auto-generation of tests and stubs:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_build_and_upload_test_and_stub_generation.png[title="fortune-service build-and-upload Test and Stub Generation"]

You should also see output in the `build-and-upload` job that shows the execution of these tests against the code.

Additionally, you should see the stub jar uploaded to Bintray along with the usual app jar.

Finally, as you run through the pipeline a second time, you should see that the contract tests from the latest prod version run against the new code in the output of the the API compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job. In this case, there is no API change. Nonetheless, the tests confirm that the latest prod version of the API can be used with the current code base.

===== 3.7 Enable Stubs for Integration Tests

Now we turn our attention to `greeting-ui`.

The following image compares the path of a request through `greeting-ui` in the build phase, both with and without stubs:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_build_flow.png[title="greeting-ui Build Flow"]

Without stubs, we expect the response to be the Hystrix fallback response that is hard-coded in `greeting-ui`. With stubs, however, we can expect the response that was declared in the contract. In this case, the stubs are loaded into the `greeting-ui` process. This leads us to our next task: Loading the stubs produced by `fortune-service`.

====== Enable the in-process Stub Runner

To load the stubs into the `greeting-ui` process, we must enable the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner dependency. This dependency start ans in-process stub runner that automatically configures Wiremock.

Add the following dependency to the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
 <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
====

====== Add Integration Tests Aligned with the Contract

Next, we add integration tests to `greeting-ui` to test for the expected response declared in the contract.

Add the following class to the `test` package in `greeting-ui`:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.fortune;

import io.pivotal.GreetingUIApplication;
import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class, webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE,
        properties = {"spring.application.name=greeting-ui", "spring.cloud.circuit.breaker.enabled=false", "hystrix.stream.queue.enabled=false"})
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"io.pivotal:fortune-service:1.0.0.M1-20180102_203542-VERSION"},
        repositoryRoot = "${REPO_WITH_BINARIES}"
        //workOffline = true
)

public class FortuneServiceTests {

    @Autowired FortuneService fortuneService;

    @Test
    public void shouldSendRequestToFortune() {
        // when
        String fortune = fortuneService.getFortune();
        // then
        BDDAssertions.then(fortune).isEqualTo("foo fortune");
    }

}
----
====

At this point, we can get through the build phase for `greeting-ui`, and the integration tests run against the `fortune-service` stubs that runs in the `greeting-ui` process on the Concourse worker.

TIP: Notice the configuration of `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`. You can replace the version with a `+` sign if using Artifactory or Nexus and it automatically chooses the latest available version on the maven repo.

TIP: Setting `workOffline=true` (commented out but shown earlier for informational purposes) would make the stub runner get the stubs from the local Maven repository. This is useful for local testing. Alternatively, set the `$REPO_WITH_BINARIES` environment variable to the value used in the credentials file before doing a local Maven build. Then the local build will download the stubs from your remote Maven repository (for example, Bintray).

===== 3.8 Enable Stubs for Smoke Tests

The following image compares the path of a request through `greeting-ui` in the test phase, both with and without stubs. Note that in the build phase, where the app process runS on the Concourse worker, we ran the stubs in the same process. In the test environment (Cloud Foundry), we run the stubs in a separate process by using a standalone stub runner application. The following image shows the test flow for the `greeting-ui` application:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_test_flow.png[title="greeting-ui Test Flow"]

As in the build phase, without stubs, we expect the response to be the Hystrix fallback response that is hard-coded in `greeting-ui`. With stubs, however, we can expect the response that was declared in the contract.

We rely on Spring Cloud Pipelines to:

* Deploy a stub runner application.
* Provide the stub runner application with the necessary information to download the stubs.
* Open a port on the stub runner application for each stub.

We rely on the stub runner application to:

* Download the stubs from our Maven repository (Bintray).
* Expose each stub on a separate port.
* Register each stub in the Service Discovery server.

The following steps describe how to configure stubs for smoke tests.

====== Provide a Stand-alone Stub Runner App Jar

In the <<tutorial-prep,Prep step>> for this tutorial, you cloned the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[`cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`] repo to your local machine. The next step is to build this application and upload it to Bintray to make the jar available to Spring Cloud Pipelines.

As mentioned in <<tutorial-stage-one>> of this tutorial, Bintray requires that a package exist before any application artifacts can be uploaded. Log into the Bintray UI and create a package for `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`. If you forked this repo, you can use the `Import from GitHub` option. Otherwise, create the package manually and choose any license (for example, Apache 2.0).

Now you are ready to build and upload this app to Bintray. Edit the following script (which shows cloning, building, and uploading) to match your Bintray URL, the Bintray ID in your `~/.m2/settings/xml` file, and the `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot` repository URL (if you chose to fork it):

====
[source,bash]
----
# Edit to match your Bintray URL and M2 repo ID setting (check your ~/.m2/settings.xml file)
MAVEN_REPO_URL=https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot
MAVEN_REPO_ID=bintray

# Clone cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot.git
cd cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot

# Build and upload
./mvnw clean deploy -Ddistribution.management.release.url="${MAVEN_REPO_URL}" -Ddistribution.management.release.id="${MAVEN_REPO_ID}"
----
====

You should now see the `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot` artifacts uploaded on Bintray.

====== Provide Stand-alone Stub Runner Application Manifest

Next, we add a manifest file for the stub runner application for deployment to Cloud Foundry.

Place this file in the `greeting-ui` repo. The file name and location can be your choice. For this example, we use `sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml`. The following image shows the file in the appropriate folder:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_stubrunner_manifest.png[title="greeting-ui Stub Runner Manifest"]

We populate this `manifest-stubrunner.yml` with the content shown in the next listing so that the stub runner binds to `service-registry`. The stub runner registers the `fortune-service` stub there so that `greeting-ui` can discover it in the same way it discovers the actual `fortune-service` app endpoint in stage and prod. From the `greeting-ui` perspective, there is no difference in how it interacts with Eureka and the stub runner application in test and the way it interacts with Eureka and the `fortune-service` application in stage and prod. The following listing shows the content of `manifest-stubrunner.yml`:

====
[source,yml]
---
applications:
- name: stubrunner
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - service-registry
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

====== Provide a Stub Runner Jar and Manifest Information to the Pipeline

Now that we have a jar file and a manifest file for our stub runner application, we need to provide this information to our `greeting-ui` pipeline so that the pipeline downloads the jar from Bintray and deploys it to Cloud Foundry. We do this through the `greeting-ui` `sc-pipelines.yml` file. We add an entry to the list of services in the `test` section, as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
    - name: stubrunner
      type: stubrunner
      coordinates: io.pivotal:cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot:0.0.1.M1
      pathToManifest: sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml
----
====

Notice that `name` matches the name of the application in `manifest-stubrunner.yml`, `coordinates` corresponds to the jar coordinates of the Maven repository, and `pathToManifest` matches our chosen fie name for the stub runner application manifest.

Note also the `type` is set to `stubrunner`, which Spring Cloud Pipelines will recognize as a stanalone stub runner app and treat accordingly.

====== Provide Stub Configuration for the Stub Runner Application

The final steps in the configuration of the stand-alone stub runner app are as follows:

* Enable the stub runner app to download the `fortune-service` stub from Bintray.
* Open a second port on the container to receive requests for this stub.

To accomplish this, we put stub and port configuration information into the properties section of the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file, by using a property called `stubrunner.ids`. This property can accept a list of stubrunner IDs. However, for this tutorial, we only have one, as follows:

====
[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
...
    <!--Tell stub runner app to start this stub-->
    <stubrunner.ids>io.pivotal:fortune-service:1.0.0.M1-20180102_203542-VERSION:stubs:10000</stubrunner.ids>
  </properties>
----
====

Spring Cloud Pipelines uses this information in two ways:

* It provides this information to the stub runner application through the application's environment variables.
** Spring Cloud Pipelines also provides the `$REPO_WITH_BINARIES` as an environment variable for the stub runner application.
** The stub runner application uses this information to download the stub from Bintray and expose it on the specified port.
* It opens the additional port specified on the stub runner app and map a new route to it.
** The format for each route is `<stub-runner-app-name>-<hostname-uuid>-<env>-<app-name>-<port>.<domain>`.
** In our example, this would be `stubrunner-cyi-test-greeting-ui-10000.cfapps.io`.

Since we bound our stub runner application to `service-registry` (Eureka), the stub runner application registers the stub URL under the `FORTUNE-SERVICE` application name on Eureka, as the following image shows:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_stub_runner_eureka_registration.png[title="greeting-ui Stub Runner Eureka Registration"]

This completes the process of configuring the stand-alone stub runner application.

NOTE: You can automate the port configuration by Spring Cloud Pipelines in the future such that you need not include the port in `stubrunner.ids`. However, for the moment, we are required to specify the port each stub should use.

====== Edit Smoke Tests to Align with the Contract

Finally, we edit our smoke tests for `greeting-ui` to ensure the response does not contain the Hystrix fallback, since we are now expecting a response from the stub. The following listing shows the edited smoke tests:

====
[source,java]
----
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
	}

}
----
====

In this case, in contrast to the integration test we created earlier for `greeting-ui`, we do not include `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`, because we are using a standalone stub runner application.

===== 3.9 Push Changes to GitHub

Push contract-based changes for `greeting-ui`. You should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `sc-pipelines.yml`
* `sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/fortune/FortuneServiceTests.java`
* `src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java`

At this point, we can run through the full pipeline for `greeting-ui` and leverage the contract-based stub in both the build and test environments.

===== Stage Three Recap

What have we accomplished?

By implementing a contract-driven approach with auto-generation of tests and stubs, we have introduced a clean, structured, and reliable way to define, communicate, document, manage, and test APIs. The benefits include the following:

* Inter-team communication can be simpler.
** Consumer and producer teams can now communicate requirements through coded contracts.
** The inventory of contracts serves as a record and reference of the agreed-upon APIs.
* Developer productivity will increase.
** Producers can quickly and easily generate contract-based stubs.
** Consumers no longer have to manually stub out APIs and write tests with arbitrary hard-coded responses. Instead, they can use the auto-generated stubs and test for contract-based responses.
** Both producers and consumers can validate their code complies with the contract.
** Producers can verify backward compatibility of API changes.
** Troubleshooting will be easier.
** Failure and feedback will be faster.


=== Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial on migrating apps for Spring Cloud Pipelines for Cloud Foundry.

Moving forward, the refactoring work shown here can be incorporated into your and your team's standard practices. We recommend the following practices:

*Good:*

* Use Maven or Gradle wrappers.
* Include a Cloud Foundry manifest file in your application repository.
* Include a pipeline descriptor (`sc-manifest.yml`) in your app repository.
* Create an empty `version` branch in your application repository.
* Include artifact repository configuration in the `pom.xml` file.
* Align your Cloud Foundry spaces with the Spring Cloud Pipelines model (isolated test space and shared stage and prod spaces).

*Better*

* Include `default`, `apicompatibility`, `smoke`, and `e2e` profiles in the `pom.xml` file.
* Organize tests accordingly in your application repository.

*Best*

* Use a database migration tool, such as Flyway.
* Use contract-based API programming.

Implementing all the *"`good`"* practices positions you to instantly create pipelines for your applications by using Spring Cloud Pipelines. This is a huge win in terms of consistency and productivity and standardization across development teams. Of course, this is an open source project, so you can modify it to meet your needs.

Implementing the *"`better`"* practices ensures the proper tests get run at the proper time. At that point, you can add as much test coverage as you need to have high confidence in your pipelines.

Implementing the *"`best`"* practices gives you additional confidence in your pipeline and encourages better programming practices for database version and API management across development teams. It also gives you higher confidence in your pipelines and lets you avoid the cumbersome business of rolling back a database.

Happy coding!

. <<concourse-start-cf,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
. <<concourse-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
. <<concourse-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
. <<concourse-fly-cf,Setup the `fly` CLI>>
. <<concourse-credentials-cf,Setup your `credentials.yml`>>
. <<concourse-build-cf,Build the Pipeline>>
. <<concourse-run-cf,Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline>>

[[concourse-fork-cf]]
==== Fork Repositories

Four applications compose the pipeline

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following repositories, because only then can you tag and push the tag to the repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-cf]]
==== Start Concourse and Artifactory

You can run Concourse + Artifactory locally. To do so, run the
`start.sh` script from this repository. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse
./setup_docker_compose.sh
./start.sh 192.168.99.100
----
====

The `setup_docker_compose.sh` script should be run only once, to allow
generation of keys.

The `192.168.99.100` param is an example of an external URL of Concourse
(equal to the Docker-Machine IP in this example).

Then Concourse runs on port `8080`, and Artifactory runs on `8081`.

[[concourse-deploy-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

When Artifactory is running, run the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.
The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----
====

As a result, both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos are cloned, built,
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[concourse-pcfdev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and do not want to use PCF Dev.
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
If that happens, <<resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

You have to download and start PCF Dev, as described  https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[here.]

The default credentials for PCF Dev are as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----
====

You can start the PCF Dev as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----
====

You must create three separate spaces, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----
====

You can also run the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` script to create the spaces.

[[concourse-fly-cf]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

If you go to the Concourse website, you should see something resembling the following image:

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you download that (and maybe, depending on your OS, add it to your PATH) you can run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----
====

If `fly` is properly installed, it should print out the version.

[[concourse-credentials-cf]]
==== Set up Your `credentials.yml` File

The repository comes with `credentials-sample-cf.yml`, which is set up with sample data (mostly credentials) that are applicable for PCF Dev. Copy this file to a new file called `credentials.yml` (the file is added to `.gitignore` so that you cannot push it with your passwords) and edit it as you wish. For our demo, set up the following:

* `app-url`: URL pointing to your forked `github-webhook` repository.
* `github-private-key`: Your private key to clone and tag GitHub repositorys.
* `repo-with-binaries`: The IP is set to the defaults for Docker Machine. You should update it to point to your setup.

If you do not have a Docker Machine, run th `./whats_my_ip.sh` script to
get an external IP that you can pass to your `repo-with-binaries`, instead of the default
Docker Machine IP.

The following table describes the environment variables required by the scripts:

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Property Name  | Property Description | Default value
|`PAAS_TEST_API_URL` | The URL to the CF Api for TEST env| `api.local.pcfdev.io`
|`PAAS_STAGE_API_URL` | The URL to the CF Api for STAGE env | `api.local.pcfdev.io`
|`PAAS_PROD_API_URL` | The URL to the CF Api for PROD env | `api.local.pcfdev.io`
|`PAAS_TEST_ORG`    | Name of the org for the test env | `pcfdev-org`
|`PAAS_TEST_SPACE_PREFIX`  | Prefix of the name of the CF space for the test env to which the app name will be appended | `sc-pipelines-test`
|`PAAS_STAGE_ORG`   | Name of the org for the stage env | `pcfdev-org`
|`PAAS_STAGE_SPACE` | Name of the space for the stage env | `sc-pipelines-stage`
|`PAAS_PROD_ORG`   | Name of the org for the prod env | `pcfdev-org`
|`PAAS_PROD_SPACE` | Name of the space for the prod env | `sc-pipelines-prod`
|`REPO_WITH_BINARIES_FOR_UPLOAD` | URL to repo with the deployed jars | `http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
|`M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID` | The id of server from Maven settings.xml | `artifactory-local`
|`PAAS_HOSTNAME_UUID` | Additional suffix for the route. In a shared environment the default routes can be already taken |
|`BUILD_OPTIONS` | Additional options you would like to pass to the Maven / Gradle build |
|======================

The right column shows the default values for PCF Dev that we set in the `credentials-sample-cf.yml`. `PAAS_HOSTNAME_UUID` and `BUILD_OPTIONS` have no default values.

[[concourse-build-cf]]
==== Build the Pipeline

Log in (for example, for a Concourse instance running at `192.168.99.100` -- if you do not provide any value, `localhost` is assumed). If you run the login script, it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it is in the same folder as the script. The following example shows how to specify an IP address for the login script:

====
[source,bash]
----
./login.sh 192.168.99.100
----
====

Next, run the command to create the pipeline, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
./set_pipeline.sh
----
====

Then you can create a `github-webhook` pipeline under the `docker` alias, using the provided `credentials.yml` file.
You can override these values in exactly that order (for example `./set-pipeline.sh some-project another-target some-other-credentials.yml`)

[[concourse-run-cf]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline

The following images show the various steps involved in running the `github-webhook` pipeline:

== Concourse Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter, we assume that you deploy your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[concourse]]
The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definitions. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and an
opinionated sample pipeline that you can use in your company.

The following projects take part in the `microservice setup` for this demo:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics]: The application that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]: Project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka]: Simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics and uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step-by-step

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible by using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<concourse-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
. <<concourse-start-k8s,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
. <<concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s,Setup the `fly` CLI >>
. <<concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s,Setup your `credentials.yml` >>
. <<concourse-pipeline-build-k8s,Setup the pipeline >>
. <<concourse-pipeline-run-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork Repositories

[[concourse-fork-k8s]]
Four applications compose the pipeline:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following repositories, because only then can you tag and push the tag to the repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-k8s]]
=== Concourse in K8S (Kubernetes)

The simplest way to deploy Concourse to K8S is to use https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm].
Once you have Helm installed and your `kubectl` is pointing to the
cluster, run the following command to install the Concourse cluster in your K8S cluster:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ helm install stable/concourse --name concourse
----
====

Once the script is done, you should see the following output

====
[source,bash]
----
1. Concourse can be accessed:

  * Within your cluster, at the following DNS name at port 8080:

    concourse-web.default.svc.cluster.local

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands in the same shell:

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080

2. Login with the following credentials

  Username: concourse
  Password: concourse
----
====

Follow the steps and log in to Concourse under http://127.0.0.1:8080.

==== Deploying Artifactory to K8S

You can use Helm also to deploy Artifactory to K8S, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name artifactory --set artifactory.image.repository=docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss stable/artifactory
----
====

After you run this command, you should see the following output:

====
[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory Pro!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc -w nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password
----
====

Next, you need to set up the repositories.

First, access the Artifactory URL and log in with
a user name of `admin` and a password of `password`.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_quick_setup.png[title="Click on Quick Setup"]

Then, click on Maven setup and click `Create`.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_maven_repo.png[title="Create the `Maven` Repository"]

[[concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

[[fly]] If you go to the Concourse website you should see something resembling the following:

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you download that (and maybe added it to your PATH, depending on your OS) you can run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----
====

If `fly` is properly installed, it should print out the version.

[[concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

We made a sample credentials file called `credentials-sample-k8s.yml`
prepared for `k8s`. You can use it as a base for your `credentials.yml`.

To allow the Concourse worker's spawned container to connect to the
Kubernetes cluster, you must pass the CA contents and the
auth token.

To get the contents of CA for GCE, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
----
====

To get the auth token, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
----
====

Set that value under `paas-test-client-token`, `paas-stage-client-token`, and `paas-prod-client-token`

[[concourse-pipeline-build-k8s]]
==== Build the pipeline

After running Concourse, you should get the following output in your terminal:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
$ echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse
----
====

Log in (for example, for Concourse running at `127.0.0.1` -- if you do not provide any value, `localhost` is assumed). If you run this script, it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or that it is in the same folder as the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ fly -t k8s login -c http://localhost:8080 -u concourse -p concourse
----
====

Next, run the following command to create the pipeline:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./set_pipeline.sh github-webhook k8s credentials-k8s.yml
----
====

[[concourse-pipeline-run-k8s]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline

The following images show the various steps involved in runnig the `github-webhook` pipeline:

== Jenkins Pipeline (Common)

In this section we will present the common setup of Jenkins for any platform.
We will also provide answers to most frequently asked questions.

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
.
├── declarative-pipeline
│   └── Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy
├── jobs
│   ├── jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy
│   ├── jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy

    └── test
----

In the `declarative-pipeline` you can find a definition of a `Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy` declarative
pipeline. It's used together with the Blueocean UI.

In the `jobs` folder you have all the seed jobs that will generate pipelines.

- `jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Pipeline plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample.groovy` - is an opinionated implementation using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample_view.groovy` - builds the views for the pipelines

In the `seed` folder you have the `init.groovy` file which is executed when Jenkins starts.
That way we can configure most of Jenkins options for you (adding credentials, JDK etc.).
`jenkins_pipeline.groovy` contains logic to build a seed job (that way you don't have to even click that
job - we generate it for you). Under the `k8s` folder there are all the configuration
files required for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

In the `src` folder you have production and test classes needed for you to build your own pipeline.
Currently we have tests only cause the whole logic resides in the `jenkins_pipeline_sample` file.

=== Optional customization steps

[[jenkins_optional]] All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[deploying-infra]]
==== Deploying infra jars to a different location

It's enough to set the `ARTIFACTORY_URL` environmental variable before
executing `tools/deploy-infra.sh`. Example for deploying to Artifactory at IP `192.168.99.100`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" ./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

[[setup-settings-xml]]
==== Setup settings.xml for Maven deployment

TIP: If you want to use the default connection to the Docker version
of Artifactory you can skip this step

[[jenkins-settings]] So that `./mvnw deploy` works with Artifactory from Docker we're
already copying the missing `settings.xml` file for you. It looks more or less like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID}</id>
			<username>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_PASSWORD}</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>${DOCKER_SERVER_ID}</id>
			<username>${DOCKER_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${DOCKER_PASSWORD}</password>
			<configuration>
				<email>${DOCKER_EMAIL}</email>
			</configuration>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
----

As you can see the file is parameterized. In Maven it's enough to pass
to `./mvnw` command the proper system property to override that value. For example to pass
a different docker email you'd have to call `./mvnw -DDOCKER_EMAIL=foo@bar.com` and the value
gets updated.

If you want to use your own version of Artifactory / Nexus you have to update
the file (it's in `seed/settings.xml`).

[[setup-jenkins-env-vars]]
==== Setup Jenkins env vars

[[jenkins_env]] If you want to only play around with the demo that we've prepared you have to set *ONE* variable which is the `REPOS` variable.
That variable needs to consists of comma separated list of URLs to repositories containing business apps. So you should pass your forked repos URLs.

You can do it in the following ways:

- globally via Jenkins global env vars (then when you run the seed that variable will be taken into consideration and proper pipelines will get built)
- modify the seed job parameters (you'll have to modify the seed job configuration and change the `REPOS` property)
- provide the repos parameter when running the seed job

For the sake of simplicity let's go with the *last* option.

IMPORTANT: If you're choosing the global envs, you *HAVE* to remove the other approach
(e.g. if you set the global env for `REPOS`, please remove that property in the
seed job

[[setup-seed-props]]
===== Seed properties

Click on the seed job and pick `Build with parameters`. Then as presented in the screen below (you'll have far more properties to set) just modify the `REPOS` property by providing the comma separated list of URLs to your forks. Whatever you set will be parsed by the seed job and passed to the generated Jenkins jobs.

TIP: This is very useful when the repos you want to build differ. E.g. use
different JDK. Then some seeds can set the `JDK_VERSION` param to one version
of Java installation and the others to another one.

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed.png[]

In the screenshot we could parametrize the `REPOS` and `REPO_WITH_BINARIES` params.

[[global-envs]]
===== Global envs

IMPORTANT: This section is presented only for informational purposes - for the sake of demo you can skip it

You can add env vars (go to configure Jenkins -> Global Properties) for the following
 properties (example with defaults for PCF Dev):

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/env_vars.png[]

[[git-email]]
==== Set Git email / user

Since our pipeline is setting the git user / name explicitly for the build step
 you'd have to go to `Configure` of the build step and modify the Git name / email.
 If you want to set it globally you'll have to remove the section from the build
 step and follow these steps to set it globally.

You can set Git email / user globally like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/git.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Fill out Git user information"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}


[[jenkins-credentials-github]]
===== Add Jenkins credentials for GitHub

[[jenkins-credentials]] The scripts will need to access the credential in order to tag the repo.

You have to set credentials with id: `git`.

Below you can find instructions on how to set a credential (e.g. for Cloud Foundry `cf-test` credential but
remember to provide the one with id `git`).

=== Testing Jenkins scripts

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

=== How to work with Jenkins Job DSL plugin

Check out the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL[tutorial].
Provide the link to this repository in your Jenkins installation.

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).

=== Docker Image

If you would like to run the pre-configured Jenkins image somewhere other than your local machine, we
have an image you can pull and use on https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins/[DockerHub].
The `latest` tag corresponds to the latest snapshot build.  You can also find tags
corresponding to stable releases that you can use as well.

IMPORTANT: The Jenkins docker image is setup for demo purposes. For example it has the following
system property `-Dpermissive-script-security.enabled=no_security` that disables script
security. *YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT ON PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING*.

to Cloud Foundry PaaS.

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline, which uses the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and a opinionated sample pipeline that you can use in your company.

The following projects take part in the `microservice setup` for this demo.

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics]: The app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part off our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]: Project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka]: Simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics and using Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step-by-step

This is a guide for the Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<jenkins-fork-cf,Fork Repositories>>
. <<jenkins-start-cf,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you do not want to use an existing one)>>
. <<jenkins-seed-cf,Run the Seed Job>>
. <<jenkins-pipeline-cf,Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-cf]]
==== Fork Repositories

[[jenkins-fork-cf]]
Four applications compose the pipeline:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following, because only then can you tag and push the tag to your repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-cf]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-cf]]
Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do so, run the
`start.sh` script from this repository. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----
====

Then Jenkins runs on port `8080`, and Artifactory runs on port `8081`.
The parameters are passed as environment variables to the Jenkins VM,
and credentials are set. That way, you need not do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be `yourForkedGithubOrg` or `yourGithubUsername`. Also the `REPOS` environment variable
contains your GitHub org (in which you have the forked repos).

Instead of the Git username and password parameters, you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
(if you prefer to use key-based authentication with your Git repositories).

[[deploy-infra-cf]]
===== Deploy the Infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-cf]]
When Artifactory is running, run the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----
====

As a result, both the `eureka` and `stub runner` repositories are cloned, built,
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[start-pcf-dev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and do not want to use PCF Dev.
In that case, the only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
If that happens <<jenkins-cf-resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins-pcfdev-cf]]
You have to download and start PCF Dev, as described https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----
====

You can start PCF Dev as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----
====

You must create three separate spaces, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----
====

You can also run the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` script to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-cf]]
==== Run the Seed Job

We created the seed job for you, but you have to run it. When you do
run it, you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global environment variables, you have to remove them from the
seed.

To run the demo, provide a comma-separated
list of the URLs of the two aforementioned forks (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics') in the `REPOS` variable.

The following images shows the steps involved:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed_built.png[caption="Step 4: ", title="This is how the results of seed should look like"]

[[jenkins-pipeline-cf]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline

We already created the seed job for you, but you have to run it. When you do
run it, you have to provide some properties. By default, we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global environment variables, you have to remove them from the
seed.

To run the demo, provide a comma-separated
 list of URLs of the two aforementioned forks (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics`) in the `REPOS` variable.

The following images shows the steps involved:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/pipeline_run.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Run the pipeline"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on *deploy previous version to stage* due to a missing jar,
that means that you forgot to clear the tags in your repository. Typically, that happens because
you removed the Artifactory volume with a deployed jar while a tag in the repository still points there.
See <<tags,here>> for how to remove the tag.

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/pipeline_manual.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click the manual step to go to stage (remember about killing the apps on test env). To do this click the *ARROW* next to the job name"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

IMPORTANT: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
For that reason, we suggest killing all applications on test. See the <<faq,FAQ>> for more detail.

[[declarative-pipeline-cf]]
=== Declarative Pipeline & Blue Ocean

You can also use the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[declarative pipeline] approach with the
https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean UI].

The Blue Ocean UI is available under the `blue/` URL (for example, for Docker Machine-based setup: `http://192.168.99.100:8080/blue`).

The following images show the various steps involved:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/blue_7.png[caption="Step 7: ", title="The pipeline is done!"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}


IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting a pipeline from a specific stage after failure.
See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33846[this issue] for more information

WARNING: Currently, there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins
blocks an executor when a manual step is required. That means that you run out of executors
pretty quickly. See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[this issue]
and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42561241/how-to-wait-for-user-input-in-a-declarative-pipeline-without-blocking-a-heavywei[this StackOverflow question]
for more information.

[[optional-steps-cf]]
=== Jenkins Cloud Foundry Customization

You can customize Jenkins for Cloud Foundry by setting a variety of environment variables.

NOTE: You need not see all the environment variables described in this section to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to make custom changes.

IMPORTANT: In this chapter, we assume that you deploy your application
to Kubernetes PaaS.

[[jenkins]]
The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline that uses https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and an opinionated sample pipeline that you can use in your company.

The following projects take part in the `microservice setup` for this demo.

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics]: The app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part of our business application.

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics ad uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step-by-step

This is a guide for a Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible by using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<jenkins-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
. <<jenkins-start-k8s,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-deploy-k8s,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>

. <<jenkins-seed-k8s,Run the seed job>>
. <<jenkins-pipeline-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork Repositories

[[jenkins-fork-k8s]]
Four applications compose the pipeline

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following repositories, because only then can you tag and push the tag to your repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-k8s]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-k8s]]
Jenkins and Artifactory can be ran locally. To do so, run the
`start.sh` script from this repo. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg yourDockerRegistryOrganization yourDockerRegistryUsername yourDockerRegistryPassword yourDockerRegistryEmail
----
====

Then Jenkins runs on port `8080`, and Artifactory runs on port `8081`.
The provided parameters are passed as environment variables to the Jenkins VM
and credentials are set. That way, you need not do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the preceding script, the third parameter
could be `yourForkedGithubOrg` or `yourGithubUsername`. Also the `REPOS` environment variable
contains your GitHub org in which you have the forked repositories.

Instead of the Git username and password parameters, you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
if you prefer to use the key-based authentication with your Git repositories.

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default, we
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline can
push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the Infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]]
When Artifactory is running, run the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.
The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----
====

As a result, both the `eureka` and `stub runner` repos are cloned, built, and
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images are built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process is reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That is why you do not have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand, if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster, the driver
is not shared by the Jenkins workers, so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

[[jenkins-seed-k8s]]
==== Run the seed job

We created the seed job for you, but you have to run it. When you do
run it, you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global environment variables, you have to remove them from the

=== Preparing to Connect to GCE

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you do not use GCE

In order to use GCE, we need to have `gcloud` running. If you already have the
CLI installed, skip this step. If not run the following command to have the CLI
downloaded and an installer started:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./tools/k8s-helper.sh download-gcloud
----
====

Next, configure `gcloud`. Run `gcloud init` and log in
to your cluster. You are redirected to a login page. Pick the
proper Google account and log in.

Pick an existing project or create a new one.

Go to your platform page (click on `Container Engine`) in GCP and connect to your cluster with the following values:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ CLUSTER_NAME=...
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ PROJECT_NAME=...
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_NAME}
$ kubectl proxy
----
====

The Kubernetes dashboard runs at `http://localhost:8001/ui/`.

We need a Persistent Disk for our Jenkins installation. Create it as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ gcloud compute disks create --size=200GB --zone=${ZONE} sc-pipelines-jenkins-disk
----
====

Once the disk has been created, you need to format it. See
the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting

=== Connecting to a Kubo or GCE Cluster

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you do not use Kubo or GCE

This section describes how to deploy Jenkins and
Artifactory to a Kubernetes cluster deployed with Kubo.

TIP: To see the dashboard, run `kubectl proxy` and access `localhost:8081/ui`.

. Log in to the cluster.
. Deploy Jenkins and Artifactory to the cluster:
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-vsphere` for a cluster deployed on VSphere
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-gce` for a cluster deployed to GCE
. Forward the ports so that you can access the Jenkins UI from your local machine, by using the following settings
====
[source,bash]
$ NAMESPACE=default
$ JENKINS_POD=jenkins-1430785859-nfhx4
$ LOCAL_PORT=32044
$ CONTAINER_PORT=8080
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} ${JENKINS_POD} ${LOCAL_PORT}:${CONTAINER_PORT}
----
====
. Go to `Credentials`, click `System` and `Global credentials`, as the following image shows:
image::{jenkins-root-docs}/kubo_credentials.png[caption="Click `Global credentials`"]
. Update `git`, `repo-with-binaries` and `docker-registry` credentials
. Run the `jenkins-pipeline-k8s-seed` seed job and fill it out with the following data
. Put `kubernetes.default:443` here (or `KUBERNETES_API:KUBERNETES_PORT`)
** `PAAS_TEST_API_URL`
** `PAAS_STAGE_API_URL`
** `PAAS_PROD_API_URL`
. Put `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` data here:
** `PAAS_TEST_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CA_PATH`
. Uncheck the `Kubernetes Minikube` value.
- Clear the following variables:
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
. Set `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` value to these variables:
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
* Set the cluster name to these variables (you can get the cluster name by calling `kubectl config current-context`):
** `PAAS_TEST_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`
. Set the system name to these variables (you can get the system name by calling `kubectl config current-context`):
** `PAAS_TEST_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_SYSTEM_NAME`
. Update the `DOCKER_EMAIL` property with your email address.
. Update the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_ORGANIZATION` with your Docker organization name.
. If you do not want to upload the images to DockerHub, update `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`.
image::{jenkins-root-docs}/pks_seed.png[caption="Example of a filled out seed job"]
. Run the pipeline
// remove::end[K8S]
// remove::end[JENKINS]

// remove::start[K8S]
== Kubernetes Setup

This section describes how to set up Kubernetes.

=== Kubernetes CLI Installation

First, you need to install the `kubectl` command-line interface (CLI).

[[kubernetes-cli-script]]
==== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/k8s-helper.sh` script to install `kubectl`. To do so, run the following script:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-kubectl
----
====

Then the `kubectl` gets downloaded.

[[kubernetes-cli-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

You can perform a manual installation for either OSX or Linux.

===== Example for OSX

The following listing shows how to manually install on OSX:

====
[source,bash]
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
----
====

===== Example for Linux

The following listing shows how to manually install on Linux:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
----
====

See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[this page] for more information.

[[start-minikube-k8s]]
=== Kubernetes Cluster Setup

We need a cluster of Kubernetes. The best choice is https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube].

TIP: You can skip this step if you have a Kubernetes cluster installed and do not
want to use Minikube. In that case, the only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
If that happens, <<jenkins-resources-k8s,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[kubernetes-minikube-script]]
==== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/k8s-helper.sh` script to install `Minikube`. To do so, run the following script:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-minikube
----
====

Then the `Minikube` cluster gets downloaded.

[[kubernetes-minikube-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

You can perform a manual installation for either OSX or Linux.

===== Example for OSX

The following listing shows how to manually install on OSX:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
----
====

Feel free to skip running `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you want to add minikube to your path manually.

==== Example for Linux

The following listing shows how to manually install on Linux:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
----
====

You can skip running `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you want to add minikube to your path manually.
See https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases[this page] for more information on the installation.

=== Run Minikube

To start Kubernetes on your local box, run `minikube start`.

To add the dashboard, run `minikube dashboard`.

=== Certificates and Workers

==== Minikube Certificates and Workers

By default, if you install Minikube, all the certificates get installed in your
`~/.minikube` folder. Your `kubectl` configuration under `~/.kube/config` also
gets updated to use Minikube.

==== Manual Certificates and Workers Setup

NOTE: If you want to run the default demo setup, you can skip this section.

To target a given Kubernetes instance, you need to pass around Certificate Authority
key and also user keys.

You can read more about the instructions on how to generate those keys https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/openssl.html[here].
Generally speaking, if you have a Kubernetes installation (such as `minikube`), this step
has already been done for you. Now you can reuse those keys on the workers.

The following inormation has been extracted from the https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/configure-kubectl.html[Kubernetes official documentation].

Configure `kubectl` to connect to the target cluster using the following commands, replacing the following values:

* Replace `${MASTER_HOST}` with the master node address or name used in previous steps.
* Replace `${CA_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `ca.pem` created in previous steps.
* Replace `${ADMIN_KEY}` with the absolute path to the `admin-key.pem` created in previous steps.
* Replace `${ADMIN_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `admin.pem` created in previous steps.

The following commands show how to perform these steps:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl config set-cluster default-cluster --server=https://${MASTER_HOST} --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-credentials default-admin --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT} --client-key=${ADMIN_KEY} --client-certificate=${ADMIN_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-context default-system --cluster=default-cluster --user=default-admin
$ kubectl config use-context default-system
----
====

=== Generate Minikube Namespaces

With the Minikube cluster running, we need to generate namespaces. To do so, run the
`./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-namespaces`.
// remove::end[K8S]

// remove::start[CF]
== The demo setup (Cloud Foundry)

The demo uses two applications: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook/[Github Webhook]
and https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github analytics code]. The following
image shows how these application communicate with each other:

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo.png[caption="The overview of the demo: ", title="Github Webhook listens to HTTP calls and sends a message to Github Analytics"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

For the demo scenario we have two applications. `Github Analytics` and `Github Webhook`.
Let's imagine a case where Github is emitting events via HTTP. `Github Webhook` has
an API that could register to such hooks and receive those messages. Once this happens
 `Github Webhook` sends a message by RabbitMQ to a channel. `Github Analytics` is
 listening to those messages and stores them in a MySQL database.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo_metrics.png[caption="Gathering metrics: ", title="Github Analytics exposes metrics that are polled by Prometheus"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

`Github Analytics` has its KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) monitored. In the case
of that application the KPI is number of issues.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo_alerting.png[caption="Alerting over metrics: ", title="Grafana alerts Slack over Prometheus metrics"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

Let's assume that if we go below the threshold of X issues then an alert should be
sent to Slack.

=== Deploying Production Applications to PCF Dev

In a real-world scenario, we would not want to automatically provision services such as
RabbitMQ, MySQL, or Eureka each time we deploy a new application to production. Typically,
production is provisioned manually (often by using automated solutions). In our case, before
you deploy to production, you can provision the `pcfdev-prod` space by using the
 `cf-helper.sh`. To do so, call the following script:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra
----
====

The CF CLI:

* Logs in to PCF Dev,
* Targets the `pcfdev-prod` space
* Sets up:
** RabbitMQ (under the `rabbitmq-github` name)
** MySQL (under `mysql-github-analytics` name)
** Eureka (under `github-eureka` name)

=== Running Prometheus on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/prometheus-on-PCF[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Go to https://prometheus.io/download/ and download the Linux binary. Then run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf push sc-pipelines-prometheus -b binary_buildpack -c './prometheus -web.listen-address=:8080' -m 64m
----
====

Also, `localhost:9090` in `prometheus.yml` should be `localhost:8080`.

The file should resemble the following listing to work with the demo setup (change `github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io`
to your `github-analytics` installation).

====
[source,yml]
----
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']

  - job_name: 'demo-app'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io']
----
====

A deployed version for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo is available https://sc-pipelines-prometheus.cfapps.io/[here].

=== Running Grafana on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/cf-grafana[Toshiaki Maki's code] to see how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Download the tarball from https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=linux
and set `http_port = 8080` in `conf/default.ini`. Then run the following the command:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf push sc-pipelines-grafana -b binary_buildpack -c './bin/grafana-server web' -m 64m
----
====

The demo uses Grafana Dashboard with an ID of `2471`.

A deployed version for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo is available https://sc-pipelines-grafana.cfapps.io/[here]

=== Running Prometheus on Kubernetes

Use Helm to install Prometheus. Later in this demo, we point it to the services
deployed to our cluster.

Create a file called `values.yaml` with the following content:

Next, create the prometheus installation with the predefined values. To do so, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name sc-pipelines-prometheus stable/prometheus -f values.yaml
----
====

Then you should see the following output:

====
[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
The Prometheus server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the Prometheus server URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9090


The Prometheus alertmanager can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-alertmanager.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the Alertmanager URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=alertmanager" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9093


The Prometheus PushGateway can be accessed via port 9091 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-pushgateway.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the PushGateway URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=pushgateway" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9093

=== Running Grafana on Kubernetes

Use Helm to install Grafana, by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name sc-pipelines-grafana stable/grafana
----
====

You should see the following output:

====
[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
1. Get your 'admin' user password by running:

   kubectl get secret --namespace default sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.grafana-admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo

2. The Grafana server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:

   sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana.default.svc.cluster.local

   Get the Grafana URL to visit by running these commands in the same shell:

     export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana,component=grafana" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
     kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 3000

3. Login with the password from step 1 and the username: admin
----
====

Perform the steps listed in the preceding output and add the Grafana's datasource
as Prometheus with the following URL: `http://sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local`

You can pick up the dashboard with the Grafana ID (2471). This is the
default dashboard for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo apps.

If you have both apps (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics`) running on production,
you can now trigger the messages. Download the JSON with a sample request
from https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/github-webhook-kubernetes/blob/master/src/test/resources/github-webhook-input/hook-created.json[the github-webhook repository].
Next, pick one of the `github-webhook` pods and forward its port
locally to a port `9876`, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=sc-pipelines-prod $( kubectl get pods --namespace=sc-pipelines-prod | grep github-webhook | head -1 | awk '{print $1}' ) 9876:8080
----
====

Next, send a couple of requests (more than four), by using cURL as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:9876/ -d @path/to/issue-created.json \
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
----
====

Then, if you use Grafana, you can see that you went above the threshold.

== Building the Project

This section covers how to build the project. It covers:

* <<building-project-setup>>
* <<building-prerequisites>>
* <<building-bats-submodules>>
* <<building-build-and-test>>
* <<building-generate-documentation>>
* <<building-distributions>>
* <<building-making-a-release>>

[[building-project-setup]]
=== Project Setup

The following diagram shows the folder structure of Spring Cloud Pipelines:

====
[source,bash]
----
.
├── common
├── concourse
├── dist
├── docs
├── docs-sources
└── jenkins
----
====

In the `common` folder, you can find all the Bash scripts that contain the pipeline logic. These
scripts are reused by both the Concourse and Jenkins pipelines.

In the `concourse` folder, you can find all the necessary scripts and setup information to run the Concourse demo.

In the `dist` folder, you can find the packaged sources of the project. Since the package
contains no tests or documentation, it is extremely small and can be used in the pipelines.

In the `docs` folder, you can find the whole generated documentation of the project.

In the `docs-source` folder, you can find the sources required to generate the documentation.

In the `jenkins` folder, you can find all the necessary scripts and setup information to run the Jenkins demo.

[[building-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

As prerequisites, you need to have http://www.shellcheck.net/[shellcheck],
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats[bats], https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]
and https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[ruby] installed. If you use a Linux
machine, `bats` and `shellcheck` are installed for you.

To install the required software on Linux, type the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y ruby jq
----
====

If you use a Mac, run the following commands to install the missing software:

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install jq
$ brew install ruby
$ brew install bats
$ brew install shellcheck
----

[[building-bats-submodules]]
=== Bats Submodules

To make `bats` work properly, we needed to attach Git submodules. To have them
initialized, either clone the project or (if you have already cloned the project)
pull to update it. The following command clones the project:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
----
====

The following commands pull the project:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
----
====

If you forget about this step, Gradle runs these steps for you.

[[building-build-and-test]]
=== Build and test

Once you have installed all the prerequisites, you can run the following command to build and test the project:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew clean build
----
====

[[building-generate-documentation]]
=== Generate Documentation

To generate the documentation, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew generateDocs
----
====

[[building-distributions]]
=== Distributions

Spring Cloud Pipelines has a lot of tests, including Git repositories. Those
and the documentation "`weigh`" a lot. That is why, under the `dist` folder, we
publish `zip` and `tar.gz` distributions of the sources without tests and documentation.
Whenever we release a distribution, we attach a `VERSION` file to it that contains
build and SCM information (build time, revision number, and other details). To skip the
distribution generation pass the `skipDist` property on the command line, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build -PskipDist
----
====

[[building-making-a-release]]
=== Making a Release

You can run the `release` task to automatically test the project,
build the distributions, change the versions, build the docs, upload the docs to Spring Cloud Static,
tag the repo, and then revert the changed versions back to default. To do so, run the
following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew release -PnewVersion=1.0.0.RELEASE
----
====

== Releasing the Project

This section covers how to release the project by publishing a Docker image.

=== Publishing A Docker Image

When doing a release, you also need to push a Docker image to Dockerhub.
From the project root, run the following commands, replacing `<version>` with the
version of the release:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ docker login
$ docker build -t springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version> ./jenkins
$ docker push springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version>
----
====

== CI Server Worker Prerequisites

Spring Cloud Pipelines uses Bash scripts extensively. The following list shows the software
that needs to be installed on a CI server worker for the build to pass:

====
[source,bash]
----
 apt-get -y install \
    bash \
    git \
    tar \
    zip \
    curl \
    ruby \
    wget \
    unzip \
    python \
    jq
----
====

TIP: In the demo setup all of these libraries are already installed.

IMPORTANT: In the Jenkins case, you also need `bats` and `shellcheck`. They are not
included in the preceding list, because the versions installed by Linux distributions might be old.
That is why this project's Gradle tasks download the latest versions of both libraries
for you.

// remove::start[CONCOURSE]
[[concourse-faq]]
== Concourse FAQ

This section covers the most commonly asked questions about using Concourse with Spring Cloud Pipeline:

Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?::
Yes To do so, change the `app-url` in `credentials.yml`!

Does this work for ANY project out of the box?::
Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline`. That is why we took some
opinionated decisions. See the documentation to learn
what those decisions are.

Can I modify this to reuse in my project?::
Yes It is an open-source project. The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written in
Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash scripts without changing the
whole pipeline. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/tree/master/common/src/main/bash[You can check out the scripts here.]
+
Furthermore, if you want only to customize a particular function under `common/src/main/bash`, you can provide your own
function under `common/src/main/bash/<some custom identifier>` where `<some custom identifier>` is equal to the value of
the `CUSTOM_SCRIPT_IDENTIFIER` environment variable. It defaults to `custom`.

I ran out of resources! (PCF Dev)::
[[resources]] When deploying the application to stage or prod, you can get an `Insufficient resources` exception. The way to
resolve it is to kill some apps from the test or stage environment. To do so, run the following commands:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----
====
+
You can also run `./tools/cf-helper.sh kill-all-apps` to remove
all demo-related apps deployed to PCF Dev.

The rollback step fails due to a missing JAR.::
You must have pushed some tags and must have also removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, remove the tags by running the following command:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----
====

Can I see the output of a job from the terminal?::
Yes. Assuming that pipeline name is `github-webhook` and the job name is
`build-and-upload` you can see the output by running the following command:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
fly watch --job github-webhook/build-and-upload -t docker
----
====

I clicked the job and it is constantly pending.::
Most likely, you forgot to click the `play` button to
unpause the pipeline. Click the top left, expand the list of pipelines, and click
the `play` button next to `github-webhook`.
+
Another problem that might occur is that you need to have the `version` branch.
Concourse waits for the `version` branch to appear in your repository. So, for
the pipeline to start, ensure that when doing some git operations, you have not
forgotten to create and copy the `version` branch too.

The route is already in use (CF)::
If you play around with Jenkins and Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied,
as indicated by a message similar to the following:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io
Binding github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io to github-webhook...
FAILED
The route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io is already in use.
----
====
+
To fix the problem, you can delete the routes, as follows:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n stubrunner-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-prod
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-prod
----
====
+
You can also run the `./tools/cf-helper.sh delete-routes` script.

I mm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars::
Most likely, you forgot to update your local `settings.xml` file with Artifactory's
setup. See <<settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml` file>>.

The `version` resource is broken. When I click on it, I get the following error::
====
[source,bash]
----
resource script '/opt/resource/check []' failed: exit status 128

stderr:
Identity added: /tmp/git-resource-private-key (/tmp/git-resource-private-key)
Cloning into '/tmp/git-resource-repo-cache'...
warning: Could not find remote branch version to clone.
fatal: Remote branch version not found in upstream origin
----
====
That means that your repo does not have the `version` branch. You need
set it up.

[[jenkins_faq]]
== Jenkins FAQ

This section provides answers to the most frequently asked questions about using Jenkins with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Pipeline version contains ${PIPELINE_VERSION}::
You can check the Jenkins logs and see the following warning:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----
====
+
To fix it, you have to do exactly what the warning suggests. Also, you should ensure that the `Groovy token macro processing`
checkbox is set.

Pipeline version is not passed to the build::
You can see that the Jenkins version is properly set. However, in the build version, it is still snapshot and
the `echo "${PIPELINE_VERSION}"` does not print anything.
+
You can check the Jenkins logs and see the following warning:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----
====
+
To fix it, you have to do exactly what the warning suggests.

The build times out with `pipeline.sh` information::
This is a Docker compose issue. The problem is that for some reason, only in Docker, the execution of
Java hangs. However, it hangs randomly and only the first time you try to run the pipeline.
+
The solution to this issue is to run the pipeline again. If it passes once,
it will pass for any subsequent build.
+
Another thing that you can try is to run it with plain Docker. That helps sometimes.

Can I use the pipeline for some other repositories?::
Yes. You can pass the `REPOS` variable with a comma-separated list of
`project_name$project_url` format. If you do not provide the `PROJECT_NAME`, the
repository name is extracted and used as the name of the project.
+
For example, a `REPOS` value equal to `https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook`
results in the creation of pipelines with root names `github-analytics` and `github-webhook`.
+
For example, a `REPOS` equal to `myanalytics$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,myfeed$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/atom-feed`
results in the creation of pipelines with root names `myanalytics` for `github-analytics`
and `myfeed` for `github-webhook`.

Can this work for ANY project out of the box?::
Not really. This is an "`opinionated pipeline`". That is why we took some
opinionated decisions, such as:
+
* Using Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner, and Spring Cloud Eureka.
* Application deployment to Cloud Foundry.
* Maven, including:
** Using the Maven Wrapper.
** Artifacts deployment by using `./mvnw clean deploy`.
** The `stubrunner.ids` property to retrieve the list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded.
** Running smoke tests on a deployed app with the `smoke` Maven profile.
** Running end to end tests on a deployed app with the `e2e` Maven profile.
* Gradle (in the `github-analytics` application check in the `gradle/pipeline.gradle` file), including:
** Using the Gradlew Wrapper.
** A `deploy` task for artifacts deployment.
** Running smoke tests on a deployed application with the `smoke` task.
** Running end to end tests on a deployed application with the `e2e` task.
** A `groupId` task to retrieve group ID.
** An `artifactId` task to retrieve artifact ID.
** A `currentVersion` task to retrieve the current version.
** A `stubIds` task to retrieve the list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded.
+
This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

Can I modify this to reuse in my project?::
Yes. It is open-source. The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written
in Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash
scripts without changing the whole pipeline.

The rollback step fails due to a missing JAR::
[[jenkins_tags]] You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, remove the tags by using the following command:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----
====

I want to provide a different JDK version.::
* By default, we assume that you have configured a JDK with an ID of `jdk8`.
* If you want a different one, override the `JDK_VERSION` environment variable to point to the proper one.
+
TIP: The docker image comes in with Java installed at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
You can go to `Global Tools` and create a JDK with an ID of `jdk8` and set `JAVA_HOME`
to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.

To change the default settings, follow the steps shown in the following images:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/global_tool.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Global Tool'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk.png[caption="Step 4: ", title="Fill out JDK Installation with path to your JDK"]

[[groovy-token-macro]]
How can I enable groovy token macro processing?::
We scripted that. However, if you need to this manually, follow the steps shown in the following images:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/configure_system.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Configure System'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/groovy_token.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click 'Allow token macro processing'"]

How can I make deployment to stage and prod be automatic?::
Set the relevant property or environment variable to `true`:
+
* `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_STAGE` to automatically deploy to stage.
* `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` to automatically deploy to prod.
+
How can I skip testing API compatibility?::
Set the `API_COMPATIBILITY_STEP_REQUIRED` environment variable
to `false` and re-run the seed (you can pick it from the seed
job's properties, too).

I can't tag the repo.::
You may get an error similar to the following:
+
====

Most likely, you passed a wrong password. Check the <<jenkins_credentials,credentials>> section
for how to update your credentials.

I am unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars.::
Most likely, you forgot to update your local `settings.xml` file with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<jenkins_settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml` file>>.

Signing Artifacts::
In some cases, it may be required that, when you perform a release, that the artifacts be signed
before you push them to the repository.
To do this, you  need to import your GPG keys into the Docker image that runs Jenkins.
This can be done by placing a file called `public.key` that contains your public key
and a file called `private.key` that contains your private key in the `seed` directory.
These keys are imported by the `init.groovy` script runs when Jenkins starts.

Using SSH keys for Git::
The seed job checks whether an environment variable called `GIT_USE_SSH_KEY` is set to `true`. If it is `true`, the
environment variable called `GIT_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID` is chosen as the one that contains the
ID of the credential that contains SSH private key. By default, `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID` is picked
as the one that contains the username and password to connect to git.
+
You can set these values in the seed job by filling out the form and toggling a checkbox.

Deploy to stage fails and does not redeploy a service (Kubernetes).::
There can be a number of reasons for this issue. Remember, though, that, for stage, we
assume that a sequence of manual steps needs to be performed. We do not
redeploy any existing services, because, most likely, you deliberately
have it set up that way. If, in the logs of your application,
you can see that you cannot connect to a service, first ensure that
the service is forwarding traffic to a pod. Next, if that is not the case,
delete the service and re-run the step in the pipeline. That way,
Spring Cloud Pipelines redeploy the service and the underlying pods.
// remove::start[CF]
I ran out of resources. (Cloud Foundry)::
[jenkins-cf-resources]] When deploying the application to stage or prod, you can get an `Insufficient resources` exception. The way to
solve it is to kill some applications from the test and stage environments. To do so, run the following commands:
