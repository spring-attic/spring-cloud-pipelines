= Spring Cloud Pipeline

_Documentation Authors: Marcin Grzejszczak_

Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are tools that allow developers speed up the
time of creating new business features. It's common knowledge however that the
 feature is only valuable if it's in production. That's why companies
 spend a lot of time and resources on building their own deployment pipelines.

This project tries to solve the following problems:

- Creation of a common deployment pipeline
- Propagation of good testing & deployment practices
- Speed up the time required to deploy a feature to production

A common way of running, configuring and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.

== The opinionated pipeline

This repo contains an *opinionated pipeline* to deploy a Spring Cloud based microservice.
We've taken the following opinionated decisions:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- usage of Maven Wrapper (we're working on Gradle)
- artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
- running e2e tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed since all the core
deployment logic is done in a form of Bash scripts.

You can go through the setup of the demo environment for

- <<concourse, Concourse>>
- <<jenkins, Jenkins using Jenkins Job DSL plugin>>

Each of these setups are available under the folders `jenkins` and
`concourse` respectively.

== Introduction

In the following section we will describe in more depth the rationale
behind the presented opinionated pipeline. We will go through each deployment
step and describe it in details.

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
.
├── common
├── concourse
├── docs
└── jenkins
----

In the `common` folder you can find all the Bash scripts containing the pipeline logic. These
scripts are reused by both Concourse and Jenkins pipelines.

In the `concourse` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Concourse demo.

In the `docs` section you have the whole documentation of the project.

In the `jenkins` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Jenkins demo.

=== How to use it?

This repository can be treated as a template for your pipeline. We provide some opinionated
implementation that you can alter to suit your needs. The best approach to use it
to build your production projects would be to download the Spring Cloud Pipelines repository as ZIP, then
init a Git project there and modify it as you wish.

Example for using the code from `master` branch.

[source,bash]
----
curl -LOk https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd spring-cloud-pipelines-master
git init
# modify the pipelines to suit your needs
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin ${YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL}
git push origin master
----

NOTE: Why aren't you simply cloning the repo? This is meant to be a seed
for building new, versioned pipelines for you. You don't want to have all of our
history dragged along with you, don't you?

=== The flow

Let's take a look at the flow of the opinionated pipeline

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow_concourse.png[title="Flow in Concourse"]

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow.png[title="Flow in Jenkins"]

We'll first describe the overall concept behind the flow and then
we'll split it into pieces and describe every piece independently.

=== Environments

So we're on the same page let's define some common vocabulary. We discern 4 typical
environments in terms of running the pipeline.

- build
- test
- stage
- prod

*Build* environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It's a CI / CD tool worker.

*Test* is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It doesn’t
resemble production, we can't be sure of it's state (which application is deployed there
and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.

*Stage* is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely applications
 are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
 Typically databases there are filled up with (obfuscated) production data. Most
 often this environment is a single, shared one between many teams. In other
 words in order to run some performance, user acceptance tests you have to block
 and wait until the environment is free.

*Prod* is a production environment where we want our tested applications to be deployed
for our customers.

=== Tests

*Unit tests* - tests that are executed on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases / HTTP server stubs etc. take place. Generally speaking your application should
 have plenty of these to have fast feedback if your features are working fine.

*Integration tests* - tests that are executed on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in memory databases / HTTP server stubs take place. According to the test
pyramid, in most cases you should have not too many of these kind of tests.

*Smoke tests* - tests that are executed on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain most money from e.g. 5 features then you could write smoke tests
 for those 5 features. As you can see we're talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
 the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
 executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.

*End to end tests* - tests that are executed on a system composing of multiple applications.
The idea of these tests is to check if the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, resources to maintain such an environment
and that often those tests are unreliable (due to many different moving pieces like network
database etc.) you should have a handful of those tests. Only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
don't even want to do those and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting you can quickly react when your deployed application
is not behaving properly.

*Performance testing* - tests executed on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle big load of input. In case of our opinionated pipeline
 these tests could be executed either on test (against stubbed environment) or
  stage (against the whole system)


==== Testing against stubs

Before we go into details of the flow let's take a look at the following example.

image::{intro-root-docs}/monolith.png[title="Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing"]

When having only a handful of applications, performing end to end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective it's maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective it's nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.

In case of microservices the scale starts to be a problem:

image::{intro-root-docs}/many_microservices.png[title="Many microservices deployed in different versions"]

The questions arise:

- Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?
  * If I queue deployments people will have to wait for hours to have their tests ran - that can be a problem
- To remove that issue I can have an environment per microservice
  * Who will pay the bills (imagine 100 microservices - each having each own environment).
  * Who will support each of those environments?
  * Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
  them up and running for the whole day?
- In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?
  * If I have development versions then I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
  That can lead to exceptions on production
  * If I test against production versions then I'll never be able to test against a feature under development
  anytime before deployment to production.

One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to... not do end to end tests.

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies"]

If we stub out all the dependencies of our application then most of the problems presented above
disappear. There is no need to start and setup infrastructure required by the dependant
microservices. That way the testing setup looks like this:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="We're testing microservices in isolation"]

Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract]):

- No need to deploy dependant services
- The stubs used for the tests ran on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests
- Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (check http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract] for more information)
- We don't have many slow tests running on a deployed application - thus the pipeline gets executed much faster
- We don't have to queue deployments - we're testing in isolation thus pipelines don't interfere with each other
- We don't have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes

It brings however the following challenges:

- No end to end tests before production - you don't have the full certainty that a feature is working
- First time the applications will talk in a real way will be on production

Like every solution it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
 allows you to configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.

==== General view

The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:

- test the application in isolation
- test the backwards compatibility of the application in order to roll it back if necessary
- allow testing of the packaged app in a deployed environment
- allow user acceptance tests / performance tests in a deployed environment
- allow deployment to production

Obviously the pipeline could have been split to more steps but it seems that all of the aforementioned
 actions comprise nicely in our opinionated proposal.

==== Opinionated implementation

For the demo purposes we're providing Docker Compose setup with Artifactory and Concourse / Jenkins tools.
Regardless of the picked CD application for the pipeline to pass one needs a Cloud Foundry instance (for example
https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services] or https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev[PCF Dev]) and the
infrastructure applications deployed to the JAR hosting application (for the demo we're providing Artifactory).
The infrastructure applications are `Eureka` for Service Discovery and `Stub Runner Boot` for running
Spring Cloud Contract stubs.

TIP: In the demos we're showing you how to first build the `github-webhook` project. That's because
the `github-analytics` needs the stubs of `github-webhook` to pass the tests. Below you'll find
references to `github-analytics` project since it contains more interesting pieces as far as testing
is concerned.

===== Build

image::{intro-root-docs}/build.png[title="Build and upload artifacts"]

In this step we're generating a version of the pipeline and then we're publishing
2 artifacts to Artifactory / Nexus:

- a fat jar of the application
- a Spring Cloud Contract jar containing stubs of the application

During this phase we're executing a `Maven` build using Maven Wrapper, with unit and integration tests.
We're also *tagging* the repository with `dev/${version}` format. That way in each
subsequent step of the pipeline we're able to retrieve the tagged version. Also we know
exactly which version of the pipeline corresponds to which Git hash.

===== Test

image::{intro-root-docs}/test.png[title="Smoke test and rollback test on test environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in Cloud Foundry
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to Cloud Foundry
- downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we're uploading it to Cloud Foundry. We want the application
to run in isolation (be surrounded by stubs). Currently due to port constraints in Cloud Foundry
we cannot run multiple stubbed HTTP services in the cloud so to fix this issue we're running
the application with `smoke` Spring profile on which you can stub out all HTTP calls to return
a mocked response
- if the application is using a database then it gets upgraded at this point via Flyway, Liquibase
or any other tool once the application gets started
- from the project's Maven build we're extracting `stubrunner.ids` property that contains
 all the `groupId:artifactId:version:classifier` notation of dependant projects for which
 the stubs should be downloaded.
- then we're uploading `Stub Runner Boot` and pass the extracted `stubrunner.ids` to it. That way
we'll have a running application in Cloud Foundry that will download all the necessary stubs
of our application
- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `smoke` profile. In the
case of https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[GitHub Analytics] application
we're triggering a message from the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[GitHub Webhook]
application's stub, that is sent via RabbitMQ to GitHub Analytics. Then we're checking if
message count has increased. You can check those tests https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/blob/master/src/test/java/smoke/IntegrationTests.java[here].
- once the tests pass we're searching for the last production release. Once the application
is deployed to production we're tagging it with `prod/${version}` tag. If there is no such tag
(there was no production release) there will be no rollback tests executed. If there was
a production release the tests will get executed.
- assuming that there was a production release we're checking out the code corresponding to that
release (we're checking out the tag), we're downloading the appropriate fat jar and we're uploading
it to Cloud Foundry. *IMPORTANT* the _old_ jar is running against the *NEW* version of the database.
- we're running the _old_ `smoke` tests against the freshly deployed application surrounded by stubs.
If those tests pass then we have a high probability that the application is backwards compatible
- the default behaviour is that after all of those steps the user can manually click to deploy the
application to a stage environment

===== Stage

image::{intro-root-docs}/stage.png[title="End to end tests on stage environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in Cloud Foundry
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to Cloud Foundry
- downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we're uploading it to Cloud Foundry.

Next we have a manual step in which:

- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `e2e` profile. In the
case of https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[GitHub Analytics] application
we're sending a HTTP message to GitHub Analytic's endpoint. Then we're checking if
the received message count has increased. You can check those tests https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/blob/master/src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java[here].

The step is manual by default due to the fact that stage environment is often shared between
teams and some preparations on databases / infrastructure have to take place before running the tests.
Ideally these step should be fully automatic.

===== Prod

image::{intro-root-docs}/prod.png[title="Deployment to production"]

The step to deploy to production is manual but ideally it should be automatic.

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in Cloud Foundry (only for the demo to pass - you should provision
the prod environment in a different way)
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to Cloud Foundry (only for the demo to pass - you should provision
the prod environment in a different way)
- downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we're uploading it to Cloud Foundry
- tagging the Git repo with `prod/${version}` tag
- in the `Complete switch over` we're currently not doing anything but you could perform some
tests on production or when doing blue / green deployment you could switch of one of the instances.
This step is manual.

== Concourse Pipeline [[concourse]]

The repository contains an opinionated pipeline that will build and deploy  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] application.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github-Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

=== Step by step

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<fork,Fork repos>>
- <<start,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<deploy,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<pcfdev,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<fly,Setup the `fly` CLI>>
- <<creds,Setup your `credentials.yml`>>
- <<seed,Run the seed job>>
- <<pipeline,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

Below you can find <<optional,optional>> steps needed to be taken when you want to customize the pipeline

- <<env,Setup Jenkins env vars (if you want to use the demo defaults and you're using Docker Machine
just check out the section on how to update the URL to Artifactory)>>
- <<settings,Add `settings.xml` for Jenkins' master (you can skip this if you want to use our defaults)>>
- <<misc,Setup Jenkins miscs (JDK installation, Groovy macro processing etc.)>>
- <<credentials,Setup Jenkins credentials>>

==== Fork repos

[[fork]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

===== Set up your local Maven to work with Artifactory

First, you have to ensure that this section is present under your `~/.m2/settings.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <id>artifactory-local</id>
  <username>admin</username>
  <password>password</password>
</server>
----

If you don't have this file just copy the one under `seed/settings.xml` or copy paste it from below

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>artifactory-local</id>
			<username>admin</username>
			<password>password</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
----

==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[start]] Concourse + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse
./setup-docker-compose.sh
./start.sh 192.168.99.100
----

The `setup-docker-compose.sh` script should be executed once only to allow
generation of keys.

The `192.168.99.100` param is an example of an external URL of Concourse
(equal to Docker-Machine ip in this example).

Then Concourse will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.

===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[deploy]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `deploy_infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse
./deploy_infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

==== Start PCF Dev

[[pcfdev]] TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./setup_spaces.sh` script to do this.

==== Setup the `fly` CLI

[[fly]] If you go to Concourse website you should see sth like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you've downloaded that (and maybe added to your PATH) you can run:

[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----

If `fly` is properly installed then it should print out the version.

==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

[[creds]] The repo comes with `credentials-sample.yml` which is set up with sample data (most credentials) are set to be applicable for PCF Dev. Copy this file to a new file `credentials.yml` (the file is added to .gitignore so don't worry that you'll push it with your passwords) and edit it as you wish. For our demo jus setup:

  - `app-url` - url pointing to your forked `github-webhook` repo
  - `github-private-key` - your private key to clone / tag GitHub repos
  - `repo-with-jars` - the IP is set to the defaults for Docker Machine. You should update it to point to your setup

If you don't have a Docker Machine just execute `./whats_my_ip.sh` script to
get an external IP that you can pass to your `repo-with-jars` instead of the default
Docker Machine IP.

Below you can see what environment variables are required by the scripts. To the right hand side you can see the default values for PCF Dev that we set in the `credentials-sample.yml`.

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Property Name  | Property Description | Default value
|CF_TEST_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for TEST env| api.local.pcfdev.io
|CF_STAGE_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for STAGE env | api.local.pcfdev.io
|CF_PROD_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for PROD env | api.local.pcfdev.io
|CF_TEST_ORG    | Name of the org for the test env | pcfdev-org
|CF_TEST_SPACE  | Name of the space for the test env | pcfdev-space
|CF_STAGE_ORG   | Name of the org for the stage env | pcfdev-org
|CF_STAGE_SPACE | Name of the space for the stage env | pcfdev-space
|CF_PROD_ORG   | Name of the org for the prod env | pcfdev-org
|CF_PROD_SPACE | Name of the space for the prod env | pcfdev-space
|REPO_WITH_JARS | URL to repo with the deployed jars | http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local
|M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID | The id of server from Maven settings.xml | artifactory-local
|======================

==== Build the pipeline

Log in (e.g. for Concourse running at `192.168.99.100` - if you don't provide any value then `localhos` is assumed). If you execute this script  (it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it's in the same folder as the script is):

[source,bash]
----
./login.sh 192.168.99.100
----

Next run the command to create the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
./set-pipeline.sh
----

Then you'll create a `github-webhook` pipeline under the `docker` alias, using the provided `credentials.yml` file.
You can override these values in exactly that order (e.g. `./set-pipeline.sh some-project another-target some-other-credentials.yml`)

==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

=== FAQ

[[faq]]

==== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! Just change the `app-url` in `credentials.yml`!

==== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions like:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- usage of Maven Wrapper
- artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
- running e2e tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

==== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written in
Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash scripts without changing the
whole pipeline. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/tree/master/common/src/main/bash[You can check out the scripts here.]

==== I ran out of resources!!

[[resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `kill_all_pcfdev_apps.sh` that will remove all demo-related apps
deployed to PCF dev.

==== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----

==== Can I see the output of a job from the terminal?

Yes! Assuming that pieline name is `github-webhook` and job name is `build-and-upload` you can running

[source,bash]
----
fly watch --job github-webhook/build-and-upload -t docker
----

==== I clicked the job and it's constantly pending...

Don't worry... most likely you've just forgotten to click the `play` button to
unpause the pipeline. Click to the top left, expand the list of pipelines and click
the `play` button next to `github-webhook`.

==== The route is already in use

If you play around with Jenkins / Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied

[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io

==== I'm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars

Most likely you've forgotten to update your local `settings.xml` with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml`>>.

== Jenkins DSL Pipeline

[[jenkins]] The repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job Dsl plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github-Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

----

In the `jobs` folder you have all the seed jobs that will generate pipelines.

- `jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Pipeline plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample.groovy` - is an opinionated implementation using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample_view.groovy` - builds the views for the pipelines

In the `seed` folder you have the `init.groovy` file which is executed when Jenkins starts.
That way we can configure most of Jenkins options for you (adding credentials, JDK etc.).
`jenkins_pipeline.groovy` contains logic to build a seed job (that way you don't have to even click that
job - we generate it for you).

In the `src` folder you have production and test classes needed for you to build your own pipeline.
Currently we have tests only cause the whole logic resides in the `jenkins_pipeline_sample` file.

=== Step by step

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins_fork,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins_start,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins_deploy,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins_pcfdev,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins_seed,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins_pipeline,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

Below you can find <<optional,optional>> steps needed to be taken when you want to customize the pipeline

- <<env,Setup Jenkins env vars (if you want to use the demo defaults and you're using Docker Machine
just check out the section on how to update the URL to Artifactory)>>
- <<jenkins_settings,Add `settings.xml` for Jenkins' master (you can skip this if you want to use our defaults)>>
- <<jenkins_misc,Setup Jenkins miscs (JDK installation, Groovy macro processing etc.)>>
- <<jenkins_credentials,Setup Jenkins credentials>>

==== Fork repos

[[jenkins_fork]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

===== Set up your local Maven to work with Artifactory

First, you have to ensure that this section is present under your `~/.m2/settings.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <id>artifactory-local</id>
  <username>admin</username>
  <password>password</password>
</server>
----

If you don't have this file just copy the one under `seed/settings.xml` or copy paste it from below

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>artifactory-local</id>
			<username>admin</username>
			<password>password</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
----

==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins_start]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----

Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins_deploy]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `deploy_infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./deploy_infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins_pcfdev]] You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./setup_spaces.sh` script to do this.

==== Run the seed job

[[jenkins_seed]] We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.

==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

[[jenkins_pipeline]] We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics`.

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/pipeline_run_props.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="You can set some properties (just click 'Build' to proceed) "]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

IMPORTANT: Most likely your 1st build will suddenly hang for 10 minutes. If you rerun it
again it should work after 2-3 minutes. My guess is that it's related to Docker Compose
so sorry for this unfortunate situation.

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on the *deploy previous version to stage* due to missing jar,
that means that you've forgotten to clear the tags in your repo. Typically that's due to the fact that
you've removed the Artifactory volume with deployed JAR whereas a tag in the repo is still pointing there.
<<tags,Check out this section on how to remove the tag.>>

environment it's good to kill all apps on test. <<faq,Check out the FAQ section for more details>>!

{nbsp}

=== Optional steps

[[jenkins_optional]] All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

==== Deploying infra jars to a different location

It's enough to provide the `distribution.management.release.url` system prop to Maven.
Example for deploying to Artifactory at IP `192.168.99.100`

Github Eureka:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka
cd github-eureka
./mvnw clean deploy -Ddistribution.management.release.url=http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local
----

Github Stub Runner:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot
cd github-analytics-stub-runner-boot
./mvnw clean deploy -Ddistribution.management.release.url=http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local
----

==== Setup settings.xml for Maven deployment

TIP: If you want to use the default connection to the Docker version
of Artifactory you can skip this step

[[jenkins_settings]] So that `./mvnw deploy` works with Artifactory from Docker we're
already copying the missing `settings.xml` file for you. It looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <id>artifactory-local</id>
  <username>admin</username>
  <password>password</password>
</server>
----

If you want to use your own version of Artifactory / Nexus you have to update
the file (it's in `seed/settings.xml`).

==== Setup Jenkins env vars

[[jenkins_env]] If you want to only play around with the demo that we've prepared you have to set *ONE* variable which is the `REPOS` variable.
That variable needs to consists of comma separated list of URLs to repositories containing business apps. So you should pass your forked repos URLs.

You can do it in the following ways:

- globally via Jenkins global env vars (then when you run the seed that variable will be taken into consideration and proper pipelines will get built)
- modify the seed job parameters (you'll have to modify the seed job configuration and change the `REPOS` property)
- provide the repos parameter when running the seed job

For the sake of simplicity let's go with the *last* option.

IMPORTANT: If you're choosing the global envs, you *HAVE* to remove the other approach
(e.g. if you set the global env for `REPOS`, please remove that property in the
seed job

===== Seed properties

Click on the seed job and pick `Build with parameters`. Then as presented in the screen below (you'll have far more properties to set) just modify the `REPOS` property by providing the comma separated list of URLs to your forks. Whatever you set will be parsed by the seed job and passed to the generated Jenkins jobs.

TIP: This is very useful when the repos you want to build differ. E.g. use
different JDK. Then some seeds can set the `JDK_VERSION` param to one version
of Java installation and the others to another one.

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed.png[]

In the screenshot we could parametrize the `REPOS` and `REPO_WITH_JARS` params.

===== Global envs

IMPORTANT: This section is presented only for informational purposes - for the sake of demo you can skip it

You can add env vars (go to configure Jenkins -> Global Properties) for the following
 properties (the defaults are for PCF Dev):

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/env_vars.png[]

===== All env vars

The env vars that are used in all of the jobs are as follows:

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Property Name  | Property Description | Default value
|CF_TEST_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for TEST env| api.local.pcfdev.io
|CF_STAGE_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for STAGE env | api.local.pcfdev.io
|CF_PROD_API_URL | The URL to the CF Api for PROD env | api.local.pcfdev.io
|CF_TEST_ORG    | Name of the org for the test env | pcfdev-org
|CF_TEST_SPACE  | Name of the space for the test env | pcfdev-space
|CF_STAGE_ORG   | Name of the org for the stage env | pcfdev-org
|CF_STAGE_SPACE | Name of the space for the stage env | pcfdev-space
|CF_PROD_ORG   | Name of the org for the prod env | pcfdev-org
|CF_PROD_SPACE | Name of the space for the prod env | pcfdev-space
|REPO_WITH_JARS | URL to repo with the deployed jars | http://artifactory:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local
|M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID | The id of server from Maven settings.xml | artifactory-local
|JDK_VERSION | The name of the JDK installation | jdk8
|PIPELINE_VERSION | What should be the version of the pipeline (ultimately also version of the jar) | 1.0.0.M1-${GROOVY,script ="new Date().format('yyMMdd_HHmmss')"}-VERSION
|GIT_EMAIL | The email used by Git to tag repo | email@example.com
|GIT_NAME | The name used by Git to tag repo | Pivo Tal
|======================

==== Set Git email / user

Since our pipeline is setting the git user / name explicitly for the build step
 you'd have to go to `Configure` of the build step and modify the Git name / email.
 If you want to set it globally you'll have to remove the section from the build
 step and follow these steps to set it globally.

You can set Git email / user globally like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/configure_system.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Configure System'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/git.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Fill out Git user information"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

==== Jenkins Credentials

In your scripts we reference the credentials via IDs. These are the defaults for credentials

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Property Name  | Property Description | Default value
|GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID    | Credential ID used to tag a git repo | git
|CF_TEST_CREDENTIAL_ID  | Credential ID for CF Test env access | cf-test
|CF_STAGE_CREDENTIAL_ID   | Credential ID for CF Stage env access | cf-stage
|CF_PROD_CREDENTIAL_ID | Credential ID for CF Prod env access | cf-prod
|======================

If you already have in your system a credential to for example tag a repo
you can use it by passing the value of the property `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID`

===== Add Jenkins credentials for GitHub

[[jenkins_credentials]] The scripts will need to access the credential in order to tag the repo.

You have to set credentials with id: `git`.

Below you can find instructions on how to set a credential (e.g. for `cf-test` credential but
remember to provide the one with id `git`).

=== FAQ

[[jenkins_faq]]

==== Pipeline version contains ${PIPELINE_VERSION}

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----

To fix it you have to do exactly what the warning suggests...

==== The build times out with `pipeline.sh` info

Docker compose, docker compose, docker compose... The problem is that for some reason, only in Docker, the execution of
Java hangs. But it hangs randomly and only the first time you try to execute the pipeline.

The solution to this is to run the pipeline again. If once it suddenly, magically passes then
it will pass for any subsequent build.

Another thing that you can try is to run it with plain Docker. Maybe that will help.

==== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! you can pass `REPOS` variable with comma separated list of
`project_name$project_url` format. If you don't provide the PROJECT_NAME the
repo name will be extracted and used as the name of the project.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `github-analytics` and `github-webhook`.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`foo$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,bar$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/atom-feed`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `foo` for `github-analytics`
and `bar` for `github-webhook`.

==== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions like:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- usage of Maven Wrapper
- artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
- running e2e tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

==== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written
in Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash
scripts without changing the whole pipeline.

==== I ran out of resources!!

[jenkins_resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `kill_all_pcfdev_apps.sh` that will remove all demo-related apps
deployed to PCF dev.

==== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

[[jenkins_tags]] You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----

==== I want to provide a different JDK version

- by default we assume that you have jdk with id `jdk8` configured
- if you want a different one just override `JDK_VERSION` env var and point to the proper one

TIP: The docker image comes in with Java installed at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
You can go to `Global Tools` and create a JDK with `jdk8` id and JAVA_HOME
 pointing to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`

To change the default one just follow these steps:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/global_tool.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Global Tool'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk.png[caption="Step 4: ", title="Fill out JDK Installation with path to your JDK"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

And that's it!

===== I want deployment to stage and prod be automatic

No problem, just set the property / env var to true

- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_STAGE` to automatically deploy to stage
- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` to automatically deploy to prod

==== I can't tag the repo!

When you get sth like this:

[source,bash]
----
