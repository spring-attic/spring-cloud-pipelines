= Spring Cloud Pipelines

_Documentation Authors: Marcin Grzejszczak, Cora Iberkleid_

Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are tools that allow developers speed up the
time of creating new business features. It's common knowledge however that the
 feature is only valuable if it's in production. That's why companies
 spend a lot of time and resources on building their own deployment pipelines.

This project tries to solve the following problems:

- Creation of a common deployment pipeline
- Propagation of good testing & deployment practices
- Speed up the time required to deploy a feature to production

A common way of running, configuring and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.

== Introduction

In the following section we will describe in more depth the rationale
behind the presented opinionated pipeline. We will go through each deployment
step and describe it in details.

IMPORTANT: You don't need to use all pieces of Spring Cloud Pipelines. You
can (and should) gradually migrate your applications to use those pieces of
Spring Cloud Pipelines that you think best suit your needs.

=== 5 second introduction

Spring Cloud Pipelines provides scripts, configuration and convention for automated
deployment pipeline creation for Jenkins, Concourse with Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes.
We support JVM languages, PHP, NodeJS out of the box. Since SC-Pipelines uses bash scripts
you can use it with whatever automation server you have.

=== 5 minute introduction

Spring Cloud Pipelines comes with bash scripts (available under `common/src/main/bash`)
that represent the logic of all steps in our opinionated deployment pipeline.
Since we believe in convention over configuration, for the supported framework and
languages, we assume that the projects follow certain convention of task naming,
profile setting etc. That way if you create a new application, it's enough for
your app to follow those conventions and the deployment pipeline will work out of
the box. Since there's no way that one pipeline can serve the purposes of all
teams in a company we believe that minor deployment pipeline tweaking should take place,
that's why we allow the usage of `sc-pipelines.yml` descriptor, that allows to
provide some customization.

From the pipeline visualization perspective, we have prepared templates for Concourse
and Jenkins (via Jenkins Job DSL and Jenkinsfile). That means you can reuse them
immediately to visualize a deployment pipeline. If you use some other tool for
continuous delivery, you can set the visualization yourself and reference the
bash scripts for each step. In other words, Spring Cloud Pipelines can be reused
with any continuous delivery tool.

==== How to use it?

This repository can be treated as a template for your pipeline. We provide some opinionated
implementation that you can alter to suit your needs. The best approach to use it
to build your production projects would be to download the Spring Cloud Pipelines repository as ZIP, then
init a Git project there and modify it as you wish.

[source,bash]
----
$ # pass the branch (e.g. master) or a particular tag (e.g. v1.0.0.RELEASE)
$ SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE=...
$ curl -LOk https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/archive/${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ unzip ${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ cd spring-cloud-pipelines-${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}
$ git init
$ # modify the pipelines to suit your needs
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin ${YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL}
$ git push origin master
----

You can also clone the repository in case you would like to keep aligned
with the changes in the upstream repository. In order not to have many merge
conflicts it's encouraged to use the `custom` folder hooks to override functions.

==== How does it work?

image::{intro-root-docs}/how.png[title="How Spring Cloud Pipelines works"]

Spring Cloud Pipelines contains logic both to generate a pipeline and the runtime
to execute pipeline steps as presented in the picture.

Once a pipeline is created (e.g. via Jenkins Job DSL or from Concourse templated
pipeline), when the jobs are ran, they clone / download Spring Cloud Pipelines
code in order to run each step. Those steps are executing functions, that are
defined in the `commons` module of Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Spring Cloud Pipelines performs steps to guess what kind of a project your
repository is (e.g. JVM, PHP), what framework it uses (Maven, Gradle), and it
can deploy your application to a cloud (CF, K8S). You can read about how
it works by reading <<how-do-the-scripts-work>> section.

All of that happens out of the box if your application follows conventions.
You can read about them in <<project-opinions>> section.

==== Supported languages

Currently we support out of the box:

* JVM
** Maven wrapper based project
** Gradle wrapper based project
* PHP
** Composer based project
* NPM

==== Centralized pipeline creation

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines to generate pipelines
for all projects in your system. You can scan all your
repositories (e.g. call the Stash / Github API and retrieve the list of repos)
and then...

* For Jenkins, call the seed job and pass the `REPOS`
parameter that would contain the list of repositories
* For Concourse, you'd have to call `fly` and set
pipeline for every single repo

TIP: This is the suggested way of using Spring Cloud Pipelines

==== Pipeline per repository

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines in such a way that
each project contains its own pipeline definition in
its code. Spring Cloud Pipelines clones the code with
the pipeline definitions (the bash scripts) so the
only piece of logic that could be there in your application's
repository would be how the pipeline should look like.

* For Jenkins, you'd have to either set up the `Jenkinsfile`
or the jobs using Jenkins Job DSL plugin in your repo.
Then in Jenkins whenever you set up a new pipeline for a repo
then you reference the pipeline definition in that repo.
* For Concourse, each project contains its own pipeline steps
and it's up to the project to set up the pipeline.

=== The flow

Let's take a look at the flow of the opinionated pipeline

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow_concourse.png[title="Flow in Concourse"]

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow.png[title="Flow in Jenkins"]

We'll first describe the overall concept behind the flow and then
we'll split it into pieces and describe every piece independently.

=== Environments

So we're on the same page let's define some common vocabulary. We discern 4 typical
environments in terms of running the pipeline.

- *build* environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It's a CI / CD tool worker.
- *test* is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It doesnâ€™t
resemble production, we can't be sure of it's state (which application is deployed there
and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.
- *stage* is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely applications
are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
Typically databases there are filled up with (obfuscated) production data. Most
often this environment is a single, shared one between many teams. In other
words in order to run some performance, user acceptance tests you have to block
and wait until the environment is free.
- *prod* is a production environment where we want our tested applications to be deployed
for our customers.

=== Tests

*Unit tests* - tests that are executed on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases / HTTP server stubs etc. take place. Generally speaking your application should
 have plenty of these to have fast feedback if your features are working fine.

*Integration tests* - tests that are executed on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in memory databases / HTTP server stubs take place. According to the test
pyramid, in most cases you should have not too many of these kind of tests.

*Smoke tests* - tests that are executed on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain most money from e.g. 5 features then you could write smoke tests
 for those 5 features. As you can see we're talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
 the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
 executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.

*End to end tests* - tests that are executed on a system composing of multiple applications.
The idea of these tests is to check if the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, resources to maintain such an environment
and that often those tests are unreliable (due to many different moving pieces like network
database etc.) you should have a handful of those tests. Only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
don't even want to do those and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting you can quickly react when your deployed application
is not behaving properly.

*Performance testing* - tests executed on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle big load of input. In case of our opinionated pipeline
 these tests could be executed either on test (against stubbed environment) or
  stage (against the whole system)

==== Testing against stubs

Before we go into details of the flow let's take a look at the following example.

image::{intro-root-docs}/monolith.png[title="Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing"]

When having only a handful of applications, performing end to end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective it's maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective it's nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.

In case of microservices the scale starts to be a problem:

image::{intro-root-docs}/many_microservices.png[title="Many microservices deployed in different versions"]

The questions arise:

- Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?
  * If I queue deployments people will have to wait for hours to have their tests ran - that can be a problem
- To remove that issue I can have an environment per microservice
  * Who will pay the bills (imagine 100 microservices - each having each own environment).
  * Who will support each of those environments?
  * Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
  them up and running for the whole day?
- In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?
  * If I have development versions then I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
  That can lead to exceptions on production
  * If I test against production versions then I'll never be able to test against a feature under development
  anytime before deployment to production.

One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to... not do end to end tests.

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies"]

If we stub out all the dependencies of our application then most of the problems presented above
disappear. There is no need to start and setup infrastructure required by the dependant
microservices. That way the testing setup looks like this:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="We're testing microservices in isolation"]

Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract]):

- No need to deploy dependant services
- The stubs used for the tests ran on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests
- Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (check http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract] for more information)
- We don't have many slow tests running on a deployed application - thus the pipeline gets executed much faster
- We don't have to queue deployments - we're testing in isolation thus pipelines don't interfere with each other
- We don't have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes

It brings however the following challenges:

- No end to end tests before production - you don't have the full certainty that a feature is working
- First time the applications will talk in a real way will be on production

Like every solution it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
 allows you to configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.

==== General view

The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:

- test the application in isolation
- test the backwards compatibility of the application in order to roll it back if necessary
- allow testing of the packaged app in a deployed environment
- allow user acceptance tests / performance tests in a deployed environment
- allow deployment to production

Obviously the pipeline could have been split to more steps but it seems that all of the aforementioned
 actions comprise nicely in our opinionated proposal.

=== Pipeline descriptor

Each application can contain a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
language_type: jvm
pipeline:
	# used for multi module projects
	main_module: foo/bar
	# used for multi projects
	project_names:
		- monoRepoA
		- monoRepoB
	# should deploy to stage automatically and run e2e tests
	auto_stage: true
	# should deploy to production automatically
	auto_prod: true
	# should the api compatibility check be there
	api_compatibility_step: true
	# should the test rollback step be there
	rollback_step: true
	# should the stage step be there
	stage_step: true
	# should the test step (including rollback) be there
	test_step: true
lowercaseEnvironmentName1:
	# used by spinnaker
	deployment_strategy: HIGHlANDER
	# list of services to be deployed
	services:
		- type: service1Type
		  name: service1Name
		  coordinates: value
		- type: service2Type
		  name: service2Name
		  key: value
lowercaseEnvironmentName2:
	# used by spinnaker
	deployment_strategy: HIGHlANDER
	# list of services to be deployed
	services:
		- type: service3Type
		  name: service3Name
		  coordinates: value
		- type: service4Type
		  name: service4Name
		  key: value
----

If you have a multi-module project, you should point to the folder, where your
module that produces the fat jar lays. In the aforementioned example that module
would be present under the `foo/bar` folder. If you have a single module project,
then you don't have to create this section.

For a given environment we declare a list of infrastructure services that we
want to have deployed. Services have

    - `type` (example: `eureka`, `mysql`, `rabbitmq`, `stubrunner`) - this value gets
    then applied to the `deployService` Bash function
        - *[KUBERNETES]* for `mysql` you can pass the database name via the `database`
        property
    - `name` - name of the service to get deployed
    - `coordinates` - coordinate that allows you to fetch the binary of the service.
      Examples: It can be a maven coordinate `groupid:artifactid:version`,
       docker image `organization/nameOfImage`, etc.
    - arbitrary key value pairs - you can customize the services as you wish

==== Pipeline descriptor for Cloud Foundry

When deploying to Cloud Foundry you can provide services
of the following types:

- `type: broker`
* `broker` - name of the CF broker
* `plan` - name of the plan
* `params` - additional parameters that will be converted to JSON
* `useExisting` - should use existing one or
create a new one (defaults to `false`)
- `type: app`
* `coordinates` - maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
* `manifestPath` - path to the manifest for the stub runner jar
- `type: cups`
* `params` - additional parameters that will be converted to JSON
- `type: cupsSyslog`
* `url` - URL to the syslog drain
- `type: cupsRoute`
* `url` - URL to the route service
- `type: stubrunner`
* `coordinates` - maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
* `manifestPath` - path to the manifest for the stub runner jar

[source,yaml]

# in order for the smoke tests on the TEST environment and end to end tests
# on the STAGE environment to pass

    - name: config-server

      plan: standard
----

Another CF specific property is `artifact_type`. It can be either `binary` or `source`.
Certain languages require a binary to get uploaded (e.g. JAVA) but with others
you have to push the sources (e.g. PHP). The default value is `binary`.

=== Project Setup

Spring Cloud Pipelines supports three main types of project setup
- `Single Project`
- `Multi Module`
- `Multi Project` (aka mono repo)

A `Single Project` is a project that contains a single module that gets
built and package into a single, executable artifact.

A `Multi Module` project is a project that contains a multiple modules.
After building all modules, one gets packaged into a single, executable artifact.
You have to point to that module in your pipeline descriptor.

A `Multi Project` is a project that contains multiple projects. Each of those
projects can be in turn a `Single Project` or a `Multi Module` project. Spring
Cloud Pipelines will assume that if there's a `PROJECT_NAME` environment
variable that corresponds to a folder with the same name in the root of the
repository, that means that this is the project it should build. E.g for
`PROJECT_NAME=foo`, if there's a folder `foo`, then Spring Cloud Pipelines
will treat the `foo` directory as the root of the `foo` project.

[[how-do-the-scripts-work]]
== How do the scripts work?

In this section you'll find description of how the scripts and jobs correspond to each other.
If you need to see a detailed documentation of the Bash scripts, you can go to the
code repository and check it out at `common/src/main/bash/README.adoc`.

```

Before we run the script we need to answer the questions related to your repo

* what is your language (e.g. `jvm`,`php`)?
* what framework do you use (e.g. `maven`, `gradle`)?

* A script e.g. `build_and_upload.sh` is called
* It sources the `pipeline.sh` that contains all the essential function "interfaces" and
environment variables
* `pipeline.sh` needs information about the project type - it
will source `projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh`
* `projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh` contains logic to decide on what the language is
** verify if a repo contains files corresponding to given languages (e.g. `mvnw`, `composer.json`)
** verify if there's a concrete framework that we support (e.g. `maven` or `gradle`)
* once we know what the project type is we can deal with PAAS. Depending on the environment
variable `PAAS_TYPE` we can source proper PAAS functions. E.g. `pipeline-cf.sh` for Cloud Foundry.
* we've got the functions loaded, now we can see if we can do some further customization
** we will search for a file called `${sc-pipelines-root}/common/src/main/bash/custom/build_and_upload.sh`
to override any functions you want
* now we can run the `build` function from `build_and_upload.sh`

[[project-crawler]]
=== Project Crawler

In Jenkins, you can generate the deployment pipelines by passing an environment variable with a comma
separated list of repositories. This however doesn't scale. We would like to automatically fetch
a list of all repositories from a given organization / team.

That's why we're using the https://github.com/spring-cloud/project-crawler[Project Crawler]
library, that is able to:

* fetch all projects for a given organization
* fetch contents of a file for a given repository

Thanks to the Project Crawler you can run the seed job and automatically all the new repositories
will be picked and pipelines will be created for them. Project Crawler supports repositories
stored at Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket. You can also register your own implementation. Please check the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/project-crawler[Project Crawler] repository for more information.


[[how-do-the-scripts-work-with-spinanker]]
=== How do the scripts work with Spinnaker?

With Spinnaker, the deployment pipeline lays inside of Spinnaker. No longer do we treat
Jenkins or Concourse as a tool that does deployments too. In Jenkins we will only create
the CI jobs (i.e. build, test) and prepare the JSON definitions of Spinnaker pipelines.

The diagram below shows how Jenkins, the seed job for Spinnaker and Spinnaker as such cooperate.

== Opinionated implementation

IMPORTANT: In the section below we're showing you a full flow of the demo apps.
It doesn't mean that your applications are required to have the same dependencies
such as e.g. `Eureka`.

For the demo purposes we're providing Docker Compose setup with Artifactory and Concourse / Jenkins tools.
Regardless of the picked CD application for the pipeline to pass one needs either

- a Cloud Foundry instance (for example https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services] or https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev[PCF Dev])
- a Kubernetes cluster (for example https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube])
- the infrastructure applications deployed to the JAR hosting application (for the demo we're providing Artifactory).
    - `Eureka` for Service Discovery
    - `Stub Runner Boot` for running Spring Cloud Contract stubs.

TIP: In the demos we're showing you how to first build the `github-webhook` project. That's because
the `github-analytics` needs the stubs of `github-webhook` to pass the tests. Below you'll find
references to `github-analytics` project since it contains more interesting pieces as far as testing
is concerned.

=== Build

image::{intro-root-docs}/build.png[title="Build and upload artifacts"]

In this step we're generating a version of the pipeline, next we're
 running unit, integration and contract tests. Finally we're:

- publishing a fat jar of the application
- publishing a Spring Cloud Contract jar containing stubs of the application
- for Kubernetes - uploading a Docker image of the application

During this phase we're executing a `Maven` build using Maven Wrapper or a `Gradle` build using Gradle Wrapper
, with unit and integration tests. We're also *tagging* the repository with `dev/${version}` format. That way in each
subsequent step of the pipeline we're able to retrieve the tagged version. Also we know
exactly which version of the pipeline corresponds to which Git hash.

Once the artifact got built we're running API compatibility check.

- we're searching for the latest production deployment
- we're retrieving the contracts that were used by that deployment
- from the contracts we're generating API tests to see if the current implementation
is fulfilling the HTTP / messaging contracts that the current production deployment
has defined (we're checking backward compatibility of the API)

=== Test

image::{intro-root-docs}/test.png[title="Smoke test and rollback test on test environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in PaaS
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS
- downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we're uploading it to PaaS. We want the application
to run in isolation (be surrounded by stubs).

TIP: Currently due to port constraints in Cloud Foundry
we cannot run multiple stubbed HTTP services in the cloud so to fix this issue we're running
the application with `smoke` Spring profile on which you can stub out all HTTP calls to return
a mocked response

- if the application is using a database then it gets upgraded at this point via Flyway, Liquibase
or any other tool once the application gets started
- from the project's Maven or Gradle build we're extracting `stubrunner.ids` property that contains
 all the `groupId:artifactId:version:classifier` notation of dependant projects for which
 the stubs should be downloaded.
- then we're uploading `Stub Runner Boot` and pass the extracted `stubrunner.ids` to it. That way
we'll have a running application in Cloud Foundry that will download all the necessary stubs
of our application
- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `smoke` profile. In the
case of `GitHub Analytics` application we're triggering a message from the `GitHub Webhook`
application's stub, that is sent via RabbitMQ to GitHub Analytics. Then we're checking if
message count has increased.
- once the tests pass we're searching for the last production release. Once the application
is deployed to production we're tagging it with `prod/${version}` tag. If there is no such tag
(there was no production release) there will be no rollback tests executed. If there was
a production release the tests will get executed.
- assuming that there was a production release we're checking out the code corresponding to that
release (we're checking out the tag), we're downloading the appropriate artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry
or Docker image for Kubernetes) and we're uploading
it to PaaS. *IMPORTANT* the _old_ artifact is running against the *NEW* version of the database.
- we're running the _old_ `smoke` tests against the freshly deployed application surrounded by stubs.
If those tests pass then we have a high probability that the application is backwards compatible
- the default behaviour is that after all of those steps the user can manually click to deploy the
application to a stage environment

=== Stage

image::{intro-root-docs}/stage.png[title="End to end tests on stage environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in PaaS
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS
- downloading the artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry or Docker image for Kubernetes)
from and we're uploading it to PaaS.

Next we have a manual step in which:

- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `e2e` profile. In the
case of `GitHub Analytics` application we're sending a HTTP message to GitHub Analytic's endpoint. Then we're checking if
the received message count has increased.

The step is manual by default due to the fact that stage environment is often shared between
teams and some preparations on databases / infrastructure have to take place before running the tests.
Ideally these step should be fully automatic.

=== Prod

image::{intro-root-docs}/prod.png[title="Deployment to production"]

The step to deploy to production is manual but ideally it should be automatic.

IMPORTANT: This step does deployment to production. On production you would assume
that you have the infrastructure running. That's why before you run this step you
must execute a script that will provision the services on the production environment.
For `Cloud Foundry` just call `tools/cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra` and
for Kubernetes `tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-prod-infra`

Here we're

- tagging the Git repo with `prod/${version}` tag
- downloading the application artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry or Docker image for Kubernetes)
- we're doing Blue Green deployment:
    - for Cloud Foundry
        * we're renaming the current instance of the app e.g. `fooService` to `fooService-venerable`
        * we're deploying the new instance of the app under the `fooService` name
        * now two instances of the same application are running on production
    - for Kubernetes
        * we're deploying a service with the name of the app e.g. `fooService`
        * we're doing a deployment with the name of the app with version suffix (with the name escaped
         to fulfill the DNS name requirements) e.g. `fooService-1-0-0-M1-123-456-VERSION`
        * all deployments of the same application have the same label `name` equal to app name e.g. `fooService`
        * the service is routing the traffic basing on the `name` label selector
        * now two instances of the same application are running on production
- in the `Complete switch over` which is a manual step
    * we're stopping the old instance
    * remember to run this step only after you have confirmed that both instances are working fine!
- in the `Rollback` which is a manual step
    * we're routing all the traffic to the old instance
    ** in CF we do that by ensuring that blue is running and removing green
    ** in K8S we do that by scaling the number of instances of green to 0
    * we're removing the latest prod git tag

    * `stubIds` task to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded

== Customizing the project

=== Overriding scripts

Since Spring Cloud Pipelines evolves, you would like to pull the changes to your
Spring Cloud Pipelines fork. In order not to have merge conflicts, the best approach
to extending the functionality is to use a separate script with customizations.

When we execute a script that represents a step (e.g. with name `build_and_upload.sh`),
after we source all the deployment and build specific scripts (e.g. `pipeline-cf.sh`
and `projectType/pipeline-jvm.sh` with `projectType/pipeline-gradle.sh`), we set
a hook that allows to customize the behaviour. If the script that we're executing
is `common/src/main/bash/build_and_upload.sh` then we will search for a script in
Spring Cloud Pipelines repository under `common/src/main/bash/custom/build_and_upload.sh`
and we will source that script just before executing any functions.

Example of such customization can be seen below:

.custom/build_and_upload.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

function build() {
    echo "I am executing a custom build function"
}

export -f build
```

when the function `build` will be called for our Gradle project, then instead of
calling Gradle build process, we will just echo the `I am executing a custom build function`
text.

=== Overriding pipelines

Currently the best way for extension of Concourse and Jenkins Jenkinsfile pipelines is to make
a copy of the Concourse pipeline `yaml`s and Jenkins seed / pipeline jobs.

==== Overriding Jenkins Job DSL pipelines

We're providing an interface `org.springframework.cloud.pipelines.common.JobCustomizer`
that allows you to provide customization for

* all jobs
* build jobs
* test jobs
* stage jobs
* prod jobs

We're using the JDK's `java.util.ServiceLoader` mechanism to achieve extensibility.

It's enough for you to write an implementation of that interface (e.g. `com.example.MyJubCustomizer`)
and create a `META-INF/org.springframework.cloud.pipelines.common.JobCustomizer` file in which you put the
`com.example.MyJubCustomizer` line.

If you create a JAR with your class (e.g. `com.example:my-customizer:1.0.0`) just put it to the build classpath

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    // ...
    libs "com.example:my-customizer:1.0.0"
    // ...
}
----

Another option is to just create an implementation in the sources under `src/main/resources/META-INF`
if you don't want to create a separate library.

Regardless of what you chose, your implementation will be executed for each job. You can add notifications
or any other customizations of your choosing.

=== Leaving what's necessary

If you want to pick only pieces (e.g. you're interested only in `Cloud Foundry` with
`Concourse` combination) it's enough to execute this command:

```bash
$ ./gradlew customize
```

You'll see a screen looking more or less like this:

```bash
:customize
  ___          _              ___ _             _   ___ _           _ _
 / __|_ __ _ _(_)_ _  __ _   / __| |___ _  _ __| | | _ (_)_ __  ___| (_)_ _  ___ ___

     |_|             |___/                               |_|



Follow the instructions presented in the console or terminate the process to quit (ctrl + c)


=== PAAS TYPE ===
Which PAAS type do you want to use? Options: [CF, K8S, BOTH]
<-------------> 0% EXECUTING
> :customize
```

Now you need to answer a couple of questions. That way whole files and its pieces
will get removed / updated accordingly. If you provide `CF` and `Concourse` options
thn `Kubernetes` and `Jenkins` configuration / folders / pieces of code in
the project will get removed.

check out the slides by https://twitter.com/ciberkleid[Cora Iberkleid] where she
migrates a setup of applications to be compliant with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

=== Introduction

This tutorial covers refactoring applications to comply with, and take advantage of, Spring Cloud Pipelines.

We will use a simple 3-tier application as an example:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_logical.png[title="Use Case - Logical View"]

At the end of this tutorial, it will be possible to instantly create a Concourse pipeline for each app and run successfully through a full lifecycle, from source code commit to production deployment, following the lifecycle stages for testing and deployment recommended by Spring Cloud Pipelines. The app code bases will be improved with organized test coverage, a contract-based API, and a versioned database schema, enabling Spring Cloud Pipelines to carry out stubbed testing and to ensure backward compatibility for API and database schema changes.

=== Sample application - initial state

The sample application is implemented using Spring Boot apps for the UI and service tiers, and MySQL for the database.

The apps are built using Maven and pushed manually to Cloud Foundry. They leverage the three Pivotal Spring Cloud Services: Config Server, Service Discovery, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard. Rabbit is used to propagate Config Server refresh triggers.

The source code for the two Spring Boot apps is stored on GitHub, as is the backing repo for Config Server.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_implementation.png[title="Use Case - Implementation"]

=== Sample application - end state

Through this tutorial, we will be adding Concourse and JFrog Bintray to manage the application lifecycle.

We will also be refactoring the application to comply with Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements and recommendations, including adding/organizing tests and introducing database versioning using Flyway and API contracts using Spring Cloud Contract.

=== Tutorial - overview

The migration steps are broken down into three stages:

. *Scaffolding*
- Minimal refactoring to comply with basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements.
- At the end of this stage, each app will have a corresponding pipeline on Concourse. The pipelines will successfully build the apps, store the artifacts in Bintray, tag the GitHub repositories, and deploy the apps to Test, Stage, and Prod spaces in Cloud Foundry.
. *Tests*
- Add/organize tests to comply with Spring Cloud Pipelines recommendations. Incorporate flyway for database schema versioning and initial data loading.
- At the end of this stage, the pipelines will trigger unit and integration tests during the Build stage, smoke tests in the Test environment, and end-to-end tests in the Stage environment. The pipelines will also ensure backward compatibility for the database, such that you can safely roll back the backend service app, even after the database schema has been updated.
. *Contracts*
- Incorporate Spring Cloud Contract to define the API between the UI and service apps and auto-generate tests and stubs.
- At the end of this stage, the pipelines will catch breaking API changes during the Build stage and ensure backward compatibility for the API, such that you can safely roll back the backend service (producer) app, even after an API change.

=== Tutorial - step-by-step

==== Prep: Before you begin

If you want to simply review the migration steps explained below, you can look at the various branches in the https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui] and https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service] repositories - there is a branch representing the end-state of each stage:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/github_branches.png[title="GitHub Branches"]

If you want to use this tutorial as a hands-on lab, fork each of the following repositories:

- https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui]
- https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service]
- https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config]

Then, create a new directory on your local machine. You may name it anything you like; we will refer to it as `$SCP_HOME` throughout this tutorial.

In `$SCP_HOME`, clone your forks of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, as well as the following two repositories:

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot]
- https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines[spring-cloud-pipelines]

Finally, create a directory called `$SCP_HOME/credentials`. Leave it empty for now.

==== Stage 1: Scaffolding

In this stage, we make minimal changes to satisfy basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements so that the apps can run through the entire pipeline without error. We make "scaffolding" changes only - no code changes.

The steps in this stage must be completed for both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`.

===== 1.1 Create GitHub branches

```bash
git branch version
git checkout -b sc-pipelines
```
Branch *version* is required to exist, though it can be created as an empty branch. It is used by Spring Coud Pipelines to generate a version number for each new pipeline execution.

Branch *sc-pipelines* is optional and can be named anything you wish. The intention is for you to use it as a  working branch for the changes suggested in this tutorial (hence we create it and also check it out).

===== 1.2 Add Maven wrapper

```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
```
This commands adds 4 files to a project:

[source,bash]
----
.
â”œâ”€â”€ mvnw
â”œâ”€â”€ mvnw.cmd
â””â”€â”€ .mvn
    â””â”€â”€ wrapper
     Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ maven-wrapper.jar
     Â Â  â””â”€â”€ maven-wrapper.properties
----

Make sure all four files are tracked by Git. For example, you can add the following to the `.gitignore` file:
```
#Exceptions
!/mvnw
!/mvnw.cmd
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
```

===== 1.3 Create Bintray maven repo package

We are using Bintray as the maven repository. Bintray requires that a package exist before any app artifacts can be uploaded.

Log into the Bintray UI and create the packages as follows. You can use the `Import from GitHub` option to create these:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/bintray_packages.png[title="Bintray Packages"]

===== 1.4 Configure distribution management using Bintray maven repo

Edit the app `pom.xml` files as follows. Make sure the Bintray URLs match the URLs of the corresponding packages created in the previous step. The values you use will be different from the example shown below.
```xml
<properties>
...
<distribution.management.release.id>bintray</distribution.management.release.id>
<distribution.management.release.url>https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service</distribution.management.release.url>
</properties>

...

<distributionManagement>
<repository>
<id>${distribution.management.release.id}</id>
<url>${distribution.management.release.url}</url>
</repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

Though not required by Spring Cloud Pipelines, it makes sense to also configure your local maven settings with the credentials to your Bintray maven repo. To do so, edit your maven settings file, usually `~/.m2/settings.xml`. If the file does not exist, create it.

Note that the `id` must match the id specified in the previous step. Also, make sure to use your username and API token (not account password) instead of the sample values shown below.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>bintray</id>
      <username>ciberkleid</username>
      <password>my-super-secret-api-token</password>
   </server>
 </servers>
</settings>
```

===== 1.5 Push changes to GitHub

Push the above changes to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two app repos:

* 4 new maven wrapper files
* a modified .gitignore file
* a modified pom.xml

===== 1.6 Add Spring Cloud Pipelines credentials file
In `$SCP_HOME/credentials`, make two copies of the file `$SCP_HOME/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/credentials-sample-cf.yml`. Rename them as `credentials-fortune-service.yml` and `credentials-greeting-ui.yml`.

CAUTION: These files will contain credentials to your GitHub repo, your Bintray repo, and your Cloud Foundry foundation. Hence, we opt to put them in a separate directory. You may choose to store these files in a private git repo, but do not push them to a public repo.

Edit the git properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown below as appropriate. For `tools-branch`, you may opt to use a fixed release (use v1.0.0.M8 or later for Cloud Foundry). Leave other values as they are, we will update those in later steps.
```yml
app-url: git@github.com:ciberkleid/fortune-service.git
app-branch: sc-pipelines
tools-scripts-url: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
tools-branch: master
build-options: ""

github-private-key: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIJKQIBAAKCAgEAvwkL97vBllOSE39Wa5ppczT1cr5Blmkhadfoa1Va2/IBVyvk

  ...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
git-email: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
git-name: Cora Iberkleid
```

Edit the maven repo properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown below as appropriate. Bintray requires separate URLs for uploads and downloads. If you are using a different artifact repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus, and the repository URL is the same for uploads and downloads, then you do not need to set `repo-with-binaries-for-upload`.
```yml
m2-settings-repo-id: bintray
m2-settings-repo-username: ciberkleid
m2-settings-repo-password: my-super-secret-api-token

repo-with-binaries: https://ciberkleid:my-super-secret-api-token@dl.bintray.com/ciberkleid/maven-repo

repo-with-binaries-for-upload: https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service
```
===== 1.7 Set Concourse pipeline

At this point, all of the build jobs, which run on Concourse workers, will succeed.

To verify this, log in to your Concourse target and set the Concourse pipelines. Update the target name in the example below as appropriate.

```bash
# Set greeting-ui pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p greeting-ui -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-greeting-ui.yml" -n

# Set fortune-service pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p fortune-service -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-fortune-service.yml" -n
```

Log into the Concourse UI and unpause the pipelines. Start each. You should see that the build jobs all succeed.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_build_success.png[title="Build Success"]

In addition, you will see a new dev/<version_number> tag in each GitHub repo, as well as the app jars uploaded into Bintray.

The test, stage, and prod jobs will fail because we have not yet added scaffolding for deployment to Cloud Foundry. We will do that next.

===== 1.8 Add Cloud Foundry manifest

If you are deploying to Cloud Foundry, you may already be routinely including manifest files with your apps. Our sample apps did not have manifest files, so we add them now.

In the `greeting-ui` repo, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:
```yml
---
applications:
- name: greeting-ui
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

In the `fortune-service` repo, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:
```yml
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

The `TRUST_CERTS` variable is used by the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services (Config Server, Service Registry, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard), which we are using in this example. The value specified above assumes deployment to Pivotal Web Services. Update it accordingly if you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, or you can leave it out altogether if you are replacing the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services with alternative implementations (e.g. deploying the services as apps and exposing them as user-provided services).

You may add additional values to the manifest files if you wish, for example if additional values are useful for any manual deployment you may still want to do, or desirable in your Spring Cloud Pipelines deployment. For example, an alternative manifest.yml for `fortune-service` could be as follows:

```yml
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  instances: 3
  memory: 1024M
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
  random-route: true
  path: ./target/fortune-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: someProfile
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

Note that `random-route` and `path` are ignored by Spring Cloud Pipelines. `instances` is honored in stage and prod, but overridden with a value of 1 for test.

===== 1.9 Add Spring Cloud Pipelines manifest

The Cloud Foundry manifest created in the previous step includes the logical names of the services to which the apps should be bound, but it does describe how the services can be provisioned. Hence, we add a second manifest file so that Spring Cloud Pipelines can provision the services.

Add a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` to each app, and include the same list of services as in the corresponding `manifest.yml`. Add the necessary details such that Spring Cloud Pipelines can construct a `cf create-service` command.

NOTE: The `type: broker' parameter shown below instructs Spring Cloud Pipelines to provision a service using `cf create-service'. Other service types are also supported: cups, syslog, route, app, and stubrunner.

More specifically, for `greeting-ui`, create an `sc-pipelines.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
test:
  services:
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
```

The `sc-pipelines.yml` file for `fortune-service` is similar, with the addition of the `fortune-db` service:
```yml
test:
  # list of required services
  services:
    - name: fortune-db
      type: broker
      broker: cleardb
      plan: spark
      useExisting: true
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
```

The values above assume deployment to Pivotal Web Services. If you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, please update the values accordingly. Also, make sure to replace the `config-server` uri with the address of your fork of the https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config] repo.

TIP: Notice the `useExisting: true` parameter above. By default, Spring Cloud Pipelines will delete and recreate services in the `test` space. To override this behavior and re-use existing services, we set `useExisting: true`. This is helpful in cases where services  may take time to provision and initialize, where there is no risk in re-using them between pipeline runs, or where it is desirable to retain the service instance from the last pipeline run (e.g. a database migration).

===== 1.10 Push changes to GitHub

Push the above changes to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two app repos:

* new app manifest file
* new sc-pipelines manifest file

===== 1.11 Create Cloud Foundry Orgs/Spaces

Spring Cloud Pipelines requires that the Cloud Foundry test, stage, and prod spaces exist before a pipeline is run. If you wish, you can use different foundations, orgs, and users for each. For simplicity, in this example, we use a single foundation (PWS), a single org, and a single user.


You can name the org(s) and spaces anything you like. Each app requires its own test space. The stage and prod spaces are shared.

For this example, create the following spaces:
```bash
cf create-space scp-test-greeting-ui
cf create-space scp-test-fortune-service
cf create-space scp-stage
cf create-space scp-prod
```

===== 1.12 Create Cloud Foundry stage and prod service instances

Spring Cloud Pipelines will dynamically create the services in the test spaces as per the `sc-pipelines.yml` file we created previously. Optionally, a second section can be added to the `sc-pipelines.yml` file for the stage environment, and these will be created dynamically as well. Prod services, however, must always be created manually.

For this example, we will create the stage and prod services manually.

Create the services listed in the app manifest files in both `scp-stage` and `scp-prod`.

===== 1.13 Update Spring Cloud Pipelines credentials file
Update the `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` credentials files with Cloud Foundry information. Replace values in the example below as appropriate for your Cloud Foundry environment.

Notice that the test space name specified is a prefix, unlike the stage and prod space names, which are literals. Spring Cloud Pipelines will append the app name to the test space name, thereby matching the test space names we created manually. The stage and prod space names are not prefixes and will not be altered by Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Note also the `paas-hostname-uuid`. The value will be included in each route created. This value is optional, but it is useful in shared/multi-tenant environments such as PWS, as it helps ensure routes are unique. Change it to a unique uuid of your choosing.

```yml
pipeline-descriptor: sc-pipelines.yml

paas-type: cf

paas-hostname-uuid: cyi

# test values
paas-test-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-test-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-test-password: secret
paas-test-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-test-space-prefix: scp-test

# stage values
paas-stage-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-stage-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-stage-password: my-super-secret-password
paas-stage-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-stage-space: scp-stage

# prod values
paas-prod-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-prod-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-prod-password: my-super-secret-password
paas-prod-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-prod-space: scp-prod
```

===== 1.14 Update Concourse pipeline with updated credentials files

Set the Concourse pipelines again, as we did previously, to update them with the values added to the credentials files. The test, stage, and prod jobs will all now succeed.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_test_stage_prod_success.png[title="Test, Stage, & Prod Success"]

On Cloud Foundry, you will now see the apps deployed in the test, stage, and prod spaces. The image below shows the deployment of `fortune-service` to its dedicated test space. Notice that the 5 services declared in its manifest files (`sc-pipelines.yml` for provisioning, and `manifest.yml` for binding) have also been automatically provisioned. The image also shows the deployment of the same app to the shared prod space. Notice that the instance of the previous version has been renamed as *"venerable"* and stopped. If a rollback were deemed necessary, the `prod-rollback` job in the pipeline could be triggered to remove the currently running version, remove the `prod/<version_number>` tag from GitHub, and re-start the former (*"venerable"*) version.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/cf_test_and_prod_deployed.png[title="Cloud Foundry Test and Prod Deployment"]

===== Stage 1 Recap & next steps

What have we accomplished?

* By adding the basic scaffolding needed to enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to manage the lifecycle of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` from source code commit to production deploy, we have made it possible for the app dev teams to instantly and easily create pipelines for each app using a common, standardized template
* We can count on the pipelines to:
- automatically provision services in test spaces, and optionally in stage as well
- dynamically clean up the test spaces between pipeline executions
- upload the app artifacts to the maven repo (e.g. Bintray)
- tag the git repositories with `dev/<version_number>` and `prod/<version_number>`
* After each successful pipeline run, we are in a position to roll back to the last deployed version using the `prod-rollback` job, if necessary

These accomplishments are extremely valuable, but in order to derive confidence and reliability from the pipelines, we need to incorporate testing. We do this in Stage 2 of the app migration.

==== Stage 2: Tests

In this stage, we enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to execute tests so that we can increase confidence in the code being deployed. We do so by adding test profiles to the pom.xml files, and then organizing and/or adding tests in a way that corresponds to the profiles. By doing so, we are establishing standards around testing across development teams in the enterprise.

We will also enable database schema versioning in this stage, thereby providing the foundation for rollback testing during schema changes.

===== 2.1 Add Maven profiles

For both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, add a `profiles` section to the `pom.xml` file, as shown below. Note that we are adding four profiles:

* default
** For unit and integration tests. Note that this profile includes all tests except those that will explicitly be called by the smoke and e2e profiles.
** Tests matching this profile will be executed during the build-and-upload job
* apicompatibility
** For ensuring backward compatibility in case of API changes. Note that this is not effective until Stage 3, when we will add contracts. However, we add this profile now to ensure the api compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job does not execute other tests.
* smoke
** For tests to be run against the app deployed in the test space.
* e2e
** For tests to be run against the app deployed in the stage space.

===== 2.2 Add/organize tests

Next, we ensure that we have a matching test package structure in our apps:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/test_package_structure.png[title="Test Package Structure"]

Note that we are creating matching packages for the default, smoke, and e2e profiles only. We will address the package for the apicompatibility profile in Stage 3.

When working with your own apps, if you have existing tests, you would move the files into one of these packages now, and rename them so that they are included by the filters declared in the profiles (i.e. the file names end in `Test.java` or `Tests.java`)

In the case of our sample apps, there are no tests, so we add some now as follows.

*fortune-service default tests*

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application running on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we will add two tests, one that loads the context, and another that verifies the number of rows expected in the database:

```java
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = FortuneServiceApplication.class)
public class FortuneServiceApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate template;

    @Test
    public void testDefaultSettings() throws Exception {
        assertThat(this.template.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) from FORTUNE",
                Integer.class)).isEqualTo(7);
    }

}
```

*fortune-service smoke tests*

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-fortune-service` space. Two versions of these tests are executed against the app:

. the current version, in the `test-smoke` job
. the latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_smoke_tests.png[title="fortune-service Smoke Tests"]

In the test environment, we choose to verify that `fortune-service` is retrieving a fortune from `fortune-db`, and not returning its Hystrix fallback response:

```java
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
```

*fortune-service e2e tests*

Add your e2e tests so that they match the e2e profile as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `greeting-ui` is also present.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_e2e_tests.png[title="fortune-service E2E Tests"]

In the e2e environment, we choose to use a string replacement to obtain the URL for `greeting-ui`. We also choose to verify that we are hitting `fortune-db` and not receiving Hystrix fallback responses from either application:

```java
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

	// The app is running in CF but the tests are executed from Concourse worker,
	// so the test will deduce the url to greeting-ui: it will assume the same host
	// as fortune-service, and simply replace "fortune-service" with "greeting-ui" in the url

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl.replace("fortune-service", "greeting-ui") + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback responses from both fortune and greeting
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.").doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
```

*greeting-ui default tests*

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application running on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we will add one test that loads the context:

```java
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class)
public class GreetingUIApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

}
```

*greeting-ui smoke tests*

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-greeting-ui` space. Two versions of these tests are executed against the app:

. the current version, in the `test-smoke` job
. the latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_smoke_tests.png[title="greeting-ui Smoke Tests"]

Since `fortune-service` is not deployed to the `scp-test-greeting-ui` space, we expect to receive the Hystrix fallback response defined in `greeting-ui`. Hence, our smoke test validates that condition:
```java
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

    @Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void should_return_a_fallback_fortune() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
                .getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

        BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

        // Expect the hystrix fallback response
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).contains("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
    }

}
```

*greeting-ui e2e tests*

Add your e2e tests so that they match the e2e profile as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `fortune-service` is also present.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_e2e_tests.png[title="greeting-ui E2E Tests"]

In the e2e environment, we choose to verify that we are hitting `fortune-service` and not receiving the Hystrix fallback response from `greeting-ui`:

```java
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
	}

}
```

===== 2.3 Enable database versioning

At this point we will also incorporate https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway], an OSS database migration tool, to track database schema versions and handle schema changes and data loading.

This change only needs to be made to `fortune-service`, since `fortune-service` owns the interaction with `fortune-db`.

*Add Flyway dependency*

We first add the Flyway dependency to the `fortune-service` `pom.xml`. We need not add a version as Spring Boot will take care of that for us.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
      <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
```

*Create Flyway migration*

Next, we create a migration directory and our initial migration file following Flyway's file naming convention:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_file_name.png[title="fortune-service Flyway File Name"]

Note the filename specifies the version (`V1`), followed by two underscore characters.

We place our CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements in our `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql` file:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fortune (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  text varchar(255) not null
);

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do what works.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do the right thing.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Always be kind.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You can always find happiness at work on Friday.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You will be hungry again in one hour.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Today will be an awesome day!');
```
*Disable JPA DDL initialization*

Now that we are relying on Flyway to create and populate the schema, we need to disable JPA-based database initialization. We can set `ddl-auto` to `validate`, which will validate the schema against the application entities and throw an error in case of a mismatch, but not actually generate the schema:
```yml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
```

There are a few options for where to store the `ddl-auto` configuration, both in terms of location (in the `fortune-service` app or on the `app-config` GitHub repo) and in terms of file name. For this example, update the `application.yml` in the `fortune-service` app for local testing. Additionally, save these values in a new file called `application-flyway.yml` on your fork of https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config].

By convention, `fortune-service` will pick up the configurations in `application-flyway.yml` if the string `flyway` is in the list of active Spring profiles. Thus, we add `flyway` to the environment variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` via the `fortune-service` `manifest.yml`:

```yml
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: flyway
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```
*Remove non-Flyway data loading*

We can now remove the old code that populated the database. In our sample app, this was found in class `io.pivotal.FortuneServiceApplication`. The following shows the code we now remove:

```java
@Bean
    CommandLineRunner loadDatabase(FortuneRepository fortuneRepo) {
        return args -> {
//            logger.debug("loading database..");
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(1L, "Do what works."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(2L, "Do the right thing."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(3L, "Always be kind."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(4L, "You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(5L, "You can always find happiness at work on Friday."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(6L, "You will be hungry again in one hour."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(7L, "Today will be an awesome day!"));
            logger.debug("record count: {}", fortuneRepo.count());
            fortuneRepo.findAll().forEach(x -> logger.debug(x.toString()));
        };

    }
```

We also no longer need the Fortune entity constructors, so we can comment these out in class `io.pivotal.fortune.Fortune` as shown below:
```java
//    public Fortune() {
//    }
//
//    public Fortune(Long id, String text) {
//        super();
//        this.id = id;
//        this.text = text;
//    }
```

*Flyway integration summary*

With that, we have completed the setup for Flyway and our database schema is now versioned. From this point onward, Spring Boot will call `Flyway.migrate()` to perform the database migration. As long as we follow Flyway conventions for future schema changes, Flyway will take care of tracking the schema version and migrating the database for us.

From a rollback perspective, Spring Cloud Pipelines includes two jobs in the `test` phase - `test-rollback-deploy` and `test-rollback-smoke` - wherein it validates that the latest prod jar works against the newly updated database. The purpose is to ensure that we can roll back the application in prod if a problem is discovered after the prod database schema has been updated, and avoid the burden of rolling back the database.

Read more about https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html#howto-use-a-higher-level-database-migration-tool[Spring Boot database initialization with Flyway] for further information, including Flyway configuration options.

===== 2.4 Push changes to GitHub

For `greeting-ui`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* pom.xml
* src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java
* src/test/java/io/pivotal/GreetingUIApplicationTests.java
* src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java


For `fortune-service`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* pom.xml
* src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java
* src/test/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplicationTests.java
* src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java
* src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql
* src/main/resources/application.yml
* manifest.yml
* src/main/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplication.java
* src/main/java/io/pivotal/fortune/Fortune.java

For `app-config`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* application-flyway.yml


===== 2.5 Re-run the pipelines

Run through the pipelines again and view the output for the jobs that run the default, smoke, and e2e tests. You will see that the tests we added in this stage were executed.

As you run through the pipelines a second time, you will see the smoke tests from the latest prod version run against the database in the `test-rollback-smoke` job. In this case there is no schema upgrade, but nonetheless the tests confirm that the latest prod version of the app can be used with the current database schema.

You can see the database version information stored in the database by Flyway either by querying the database itself or by hitting the flyway endpoint on the `fortune-service` URL. Here is an example from the scp-stage environment:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_schema_info.png[title="fortune-service Flyway Schema Info"]

===== Stage 2 Recap & next steps

What have we accomplished?

* By integrating our applications with the testing strategy built into Spring Cloud Pipelines, we have increased the effectiveness of the pipelines, as well as our confidence in them
* Established a standard approach to organizing tests that will bring consistency within and across development teams
* Enabled auto-managed database versioning and backward compatibility testing that will alleviate database schema management throughout the release management lifecycle

We are now positioned to add any unit, integration, smoke, and end-to-end tests to our code base and extract a very high level of reliability and confidence from our pipelines. We are also better positioned to ensure that our dev teams conform to these practices, given the structure established by Spring Cloud Pipelines and the fast feedback and visibility we gain from the pipelines as they execute the tests.

However, we could benefit further by incorporating contracts to define and test the API integration points between applications. We do this in Stage 3 of the app migration.

==== Stage 3: Contracts

In this stage, we introduce contract-based programming practices into our sample application. Doing so improves API management capabilities, including defining, communicating, and testing API semantics. It also enables us to catch breaking API changes (i.e. validate API backward compatibility) in the build phase. This will extend the effectiveness of the pipelines, encourage better communication and programming practices across development teams, and provide faster feedback to developers.

We will integrate Spring Cloud Contract and add contracts, stubs, and a stub runner. We will also now complete and make use of the apicompatibility profile defined in Stage 2.

===== 3.1 Create a contract

Let's start by creating the contract for the interaction between `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`. The contract should describe the following expectation:

* `greeting-ui` makes a `GET` request to the root URL of `fortune-service` and expects a response with status 200 and a string ("foo fortune") in the body

We codify this using groovy syntax as follows:

```groovy
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description("""
should return a fortune string
""")
    request {
        method GET()
        url "/"
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body "foo fortune"
    }
}
```

Save this contract in the `fortune-service` code base in the following location, which is compliant with Spring Cloud Contract convention (`src/test/resources/contracts/<service-name>/<contract-file>`):

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_contract_file.png[title="fortune-service Flyway Contract File"]

NOTE: You can optionally enable your IDE to assist with contract syntax by adding the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to your `pom.xml` file. It is pluggable, and includes groovy and pact by default.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
```

===== 3.2 Create a base class for contract tests

Now that we have a codified contract, we want to enable auto-generation of contract-based tests. The auto-generation, which we will configure in the next steps, requires a base class that stubs out the service that satisfies the API call, so that we can run the test without external dependencies (e.g. the DB). The objective is to focus on testing API semantics.

We create the base class in the `fortune-service` test package as follows:


```java
package io.pivotal.fortune;

import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.mockito.BDDMockito;

public class BaseClass {

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        FortuneService service = BDDMockito.mock(FortuneService.class);
        BDDMockito.given(service.getFortune()).willReturn("foo fortune");
        RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new FortuneController(service));
    }
}
```

===== 3.3 Enable automated contract-based testing

Now that we have a contract and a base class, we can use the *Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin* to auto-generate contract tests, stubs, and a stub jar.

First we add the Spring Cloud Contract version to the list of properties in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file, since we will reference it when we enable the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin:

```xml
  <properties>
...
    <spring-cloud-contract.version>1.2.1.RELEASE</spring-cloud-contract.version>
...
</properties>
```

Next, we edit the `default` profile in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file as follows:

* Add a plugin block for Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin
* Configure it to use our base class (`io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass`) to generate tests
* Configure it to place auto-generated tests in the test package `io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests`

Note that the package of the contracttests will be included by the `include` filter in the `default` profile, so these tests will be run against the app during the `build-and-upload` job. For `fortune-service`, this serves to validate that the app conforms to the contract.

Here is the complete profile:
```xml
    <profile>
      <id>default</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>

When the app is built, the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin will also now produce a stub and a stub jar containing the contract and stub. This stub jar will be uploaded to Bintray, along with the usual app jar. As we will see shortly, this stub jar can be used by the `greeting-ui` dev team while they wait for `fortune-service` to be completed. In other words, this gives the `greeting-ui` dev team a producer to test against that is based on a mutually agreed-upon contract without the lead time of having to wait for `fortune-service` to implement anything more than a base class, and without having to manually stub out calls to `fortune-service` based on arbitrary or static responses.

TIP: Package the project locally (run `mvn package`) to observe the tests, stubs, and stub jar that the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin generates. See the image below for reference.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_generated_tests.png[title="Generated Tests and Stubs"]

===== 3.4 Enable backward compatibility API check

To enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to catch any breaking API changes during the the api compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job, we add the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin to the `apicompatibility` profile as well.

In this case, we want the plugin to generate tests based on contracts outside of the project (the ones from the latest prod version), so we configure the plugin to download the latest prod stub jar, which contains the old contract. The plugin will use the old contract and the specified base class, which in our example is the same as the one in the previous step, to generate contract tests. These tests are run against the new code to validate that it is still compatible with consumers complying with the prior contract. This ensures backward compatibility for the API.

In short, we edit the apicompatibility profile in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file as follows:

* Add a plugin block for Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin
* Configure it to download the latest prod stub jar from Bintray to obtain the old contract
* Configure it to use our base class (`io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass`) to generate tests (we are using the same one as in the prior step)
* Configure it to place auto-generated tests in the test package `io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests`

Note that the package of the contracttests matches the `include` filter in the `apicompatibility` profile, so these tests will be run against the app during the the api compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job. For `fortune-service`, this serves to validate that the app conforms to the old contract.

Here is the complete profile:

```xml
    <profile>
      <id>apicompatibility</id>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
              <includes>

          </plugin>
          <!--Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin -->

            <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
            <extensions>true</extensions>
            <configuration>
              <contractsRepositoryUrl>${repo.with.binaries}</contractsRepositoryUrl>
              <contractDependency>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <classifier>stubs</classifier>
                <version>${latest.production.version}</version>

            </configuration>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
```

The values for `${repo.with.binaries}` and `${latest.production.version}` will be injected dynamically by Spring Cloud Pipelines. You can run this locally by providing these values manually as system properties in the maven command.

===== 3.5 Push changes to GitHub

All changes in Stage 3 thus far are in `fortune-service`. At this point, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* pom.xml
* src/test/resources/contracts/greeting-ui/shouldReturnAFortune.groovy
* src/test/java/io/pivotal/fortune/BaseClass.java

===== 3.6 Re-run the fortune-service pipeline

Run through the `fortune-service` pipeline to generate stubs. The following output from the `build-and-upload` job shows the auto-generation of tests and stubs:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_build_and_upload_test_and_stub_generation.png[title="fortune-service build-and-upload Test and Stub Generation"]

You will also see output in the `build-and-upload` job showing the execution of these tests against the code.

Additionally, you will see the stub jar uploaded to Bintray along with the usual app jar.

Finally, as you run through the pipeline a second time, you will see the contract tests from the latest prod version run against the new code in the output of the the api compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job. In this case there is no API change, but nonetheless the tests confirm that the latest prod version of the API can be used with the current code base.

===== 3.7 Enable stubs for integration tests

We are in the home stretch! Let's turn our attention to `greeting-ui`.

The following image compares the path of a request through `greeting-ui` in the build phase, both with and without stubs.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_build_flow.png[title="greeting-ui Build Flow"]

Without stubs, we expect the response to be the hystrix fallback response that is hard-coded in `greeting-ui`. With stubs, however, we can expect the response that was declared in the contract. In this case, the stubs are loaded into the `greeting-ui` process. This leads us to our next task: load the stubs produced by `fortune-service`.

*Enable in-process stub runner*

To load the stubs into the `greeting-ui` process, we must enable the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner dependency. This dependency will start an in-process stub runner that automatically configures Wiremock.

Add the following to the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
 <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

*Add integration tests aligned with the contract*

Next, we add integration tests to `greeting-ui` that test for the expected response declared in the contract.

Add the following class to the test package in `greeting-ui`:

```java
package io.pivotal.fortune;

import io.pivotal.GreetingUIApplication;
import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class, webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE,
        properties = {"spring.application.name=greeting-ui", "spring.cloud.circuit.breaker.enabled=false", "hystrix.stream.queue.enabled=false"})
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"io.pivotal:fortune-service:1.0.0.M1-20180102_203542-VERSION"},
        repositoryRoot = "${REPO_WITH_BINARIES}"
        //workOffline = true
)

public class FortuneServiceTests {

    @Autowired FortuneService fortuneService;

    @Test
    public void shouldSendRequestToFortune() {
        // when
        String fortune = fortuneService.getFortune();
        // then
        BDDAssertions.then(fortune).isEqualTo("foo fortune");
    }

}
```

At this point, we can get through the build phase for `greeting-ui`, and the integration tests will be executed against the `fortune-service` stubs running in the `greeting-ui` process on the Concourse worker.

TIP: Notice the configuration of `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` - you can replace the version with a `+` sign if using Artifactory or Nexus and it will automatically choose the latest available version on the maven repo.

TIP: Setting `workOffline=true` (commented out but shown for informational purposes above) would make the stub runner get the stubs from the local maven repo. This is useful for local testing. Alternatively, set the `$REPO_WITH_BINARIES` environment variable to the value used in the credentials file before doing a local maven build, and the local build will download the stubs from your remote maven repo (e.g. Bintray).

===== 3.8 Enable stubs for smoke tests

The following image compares the path of a request through `greeting-ui` in the test phase, both with and without stubs. Note that in the build phase, where the app process is running on the Concourse worker, we ran the stubs in the same process. In the test environment (Cloud Foundry), we will run the stubs in a separate process using a standalone stub runner application.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_test_flow.png[title="greeting-ui Test Flow"]

As in the build phase, without stubs we expect the response to be the hystrix fallback response that is hard-coded in `greeting-ui`. With stubs, however, we can expect the response that was declared in the contract.

We will rely on Spring Cloud Pipelines to:

* Deploy a stub runner application
* Provide the stub runner application the necessary information to download the stubs
* Open a port on the stub runner application for each stub

We will rely on the stub runner application to:

* Download the stubs from our maven repo (Bintray)
* Expose each stub on a separate port
* Register each stub in the Service Discovery server

The following steps describe how to configure this.

*Provide standalone stub runner app jar*

In the Prep step for this tutorial, you cloned the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot] repo to your local machine. The next step is to build this app and upload it to Bintray to make the jar available to Spring Cloud Pipelines.

As mentioned in Stage 1 of this tutorial, Bintray requires that a package exist before any app artifacts can be uploaded. Log into the Bintray UI and create a package for `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`. If you forked this repo, you can use the `Import from GitHub` option. Otherwise, create the package manually and choose any license (e.g. Apache 2.0).

Now you are ready to build and upload this app to Bintray. The following script shows cloning, building and uploading. Edit as appropriate to match your Bintray URL, the Bintray ID in your `~/.m2/settings/xml` file, and the `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot` repo URL if you chose to fork it.

```bash
# Edit to match your Bintray URL and M2 repo ID setting (check your ~/.m2/settings.xml file)
MAVEN_REPO_URL=https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot
MAVEN_REPO_ID=bintray

# Clone cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot.git
cd cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot

# Build and upload
./mvnw clean deploy -Ddistribution.management.release.url="${MAVEN_REPO_URL}" -Ddistribution.management.release.id="${MAVEN_REPO_ID}"
```

You should now see the `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot` artifacts uploaded on Bintray.

*Provide standalone stub runner app manifest*

Next, we add a manifest file for the stub runner app for deployment to Cloud Foundry.

We will place this file in the `greeting-ui` repo. The file name and location can be your choice. For this example, we will use `sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml`:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_stubrunner_manifest.png[title="greeting-ui Stub Runner Manifest"]

We populate this `manifest-stubrunner.yml` with the content shown below so that the stub runner binds to `service-registry`. The stub runner will register the `fortune-service` stub there so that `greeting-ui` can discover it in the same way it will discover the actual `fortune-service` app endpoint in stage and prod. From the `greeting-ui` perspective, there is no difference in how it interacts with Eureka and the stub runner app in test and the way it will interact with Eureka and the `fortune-service` app in stage and prod.

```yml
---
applications:
- name: stubrunner
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - service-registry
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

*Provide stub runner jar and manifest info to the pipeline*

Now that we have a jar file and manifest file for our stub runner app, we need to provide this information to our `greeting-ui` pipeline so that the pipeline downloads the jar from Bintray and deploys it to Cloud Foundry. We do this through the `greeting-ui` `sc-pipelines.yml` file. We add an entry to the list of services in the `test` section, as follows:

```yml
    - name: stubrunner
      type: stubrunner
      coordinates: io.pivotal:cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot:0.0.1.M1
      pathToManifest: sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml
```

Notice that `name` matches the name of the app in `manifest-stubrunner.yml`, `coordinates` corresponds to the jar coordinates on the maven repo, and `pathToManifest` matches our chosen fie name for the stub runner app manifest.

Note also the `type` is set to `stubrunner`, which Spring Cloud Pipelines will recognize as a stanalone stub runner app and treat accordingly.

*Provide stub configuration for stub runner app*

The final steps in the configuration of the standalone stub runner app are:

* Enable the stub runner app to download the `fortune-service` stub from Bintray
* Open a second port on the container to receive requests for this stub

To accomplish this, we put stub and port configuration information into the properties section of the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file, using a property called `stubrunner.ids`. This property can accept a list of stubrunner ids, but for this tutorial, we only have one:

```xml
  <properties>
...
    <!--Tell stub runner app to start this stub-->
    <stubrunner.ids>io.pivotal:fortune-service:1.0.0.M1-20180102_203542-VERSION:stubs:10000</stubrunner.ids>
  </properties>
```

Spring Cloud Pipelines will use this information in two ways:

. It will provide this information to the stub runner app via the app's environment variables
- Spring Cloud Pipelines will also provide the `$REPO_WITH_BINARIES` as an env var for the stub runner app
- The stub runner app will use this information to download the stub from Bintray and expose it on the specified port
. It will open the additional port specified on the stub runner app and map a new route to it
- The format for each route will be `<stub-runner-app-name>-<hostname-uuid>-<env>-<app-name>-<port>.<domain>`
- In our example, this would be `stubrunner-cyi-test-greeting-ui-10000.cfapps.io`

Since we bound our stub runner app to `service-registry` (Eureka), the stub runner app will register the stub URL under the application name `FORTUNE-SERVICE` on Eureka:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_stub_runner_eureka_registration.png[title="greeting-ui Stub Runner Eureka Registration"]

This completes the process of configuring the standalone stub runner application.

NOTE: The port configuration may be automated by Spring Cloud Pipelines in the future, such that it will not be necessary to include the port in the `stubrunner.ids`, but for the moment, we are required to specify the port each stub should use.

*Edit smoke tests to align with the contract*

Finally, we edit our smoke tests for `greeting-ui` to ensure the response does *not* contain the hystrix fallback, since we are now expecting a response from the stub.

```java
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
	}

}
```

In this case, in contrast to the integration test we created earlier for `greeting-ui`, we do not include `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` since we are using a standalone stub runner application.

===== 3.9 Push changes to GitHub

Push contract-based changes for `greeting-ui`. You should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* pom.xml
* sc-pipelines.yml
* sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml
* src/test/java/io/pivotal/fortune/FortuneServiceTests.java
* src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java

At this point, we can run through the full pipeline for `greeting-ui` and leverage the contract-based stub in both the build and test environments.

===== Stage 3 Recap

What have we accomplished?

By implementing a contract-driven approach with auto-generation of tests and stubs, we have introduced a clean, structured, and reliable way to define, communicate, document, manage and test APIs

* Inter-team communication will be simpler
- Consumer and producer teams can now communicate requirements through codified contracts
- The inventory of contracts serves as a record and reference of the agreed upon APIs
* Developer productivity will increase
- Producers can quickly and easily generate contract-based stubs
- Consumers no longer have to manually stub out APIs and write tests with arbitrary hard-coded responses - instead they can use the auto-generated stubs and test for contract-based responses
- Both producers and consumers can validate they are compliant with the contract
- Producers can verify backward compatibility of API changes
- Troubleshooting will be easier
- Failure and feedback will be faster


=== Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial on migrating apps for Spring Cloud Pipelines for Cloud Foundry.

Moving forward, the refactoring work needed here can be incorporated into your and/or your team's standard practices. In short:

*Good:*

* Use maven or gradle wrappers
* Include a Cloud Foundry manifest file in your app repo
* Include a pipeline descriptor (`sc-manifest.yml`) in your app repo
* Create an empty `version` branch in your app repo
* Include artifact repository configuration in the pom.xml file
* Align your Cloud Foundry spaces with Spring Cloud Pipelines model (isolated test space, shared stage and prod spaces)

*Better*

* Include default, apicompatibility, smoke, and e2e profiles in the pom.xml file
* Organize tests accordingly in your app repo

*Best*

* Use a database migration tool like flyway
* Use contract-based API programming

Implementing all the *"good"* practices above already positions you to instantly create pipelines for your apps usign Spring Cloud Pipelines. This is a huge win in terms of consistency and productivity, and standardization across development teams. Of course, this is an open source project, so it can be modified to meet your needs.

Implementing the *"better"* practices will ensure the proper tests get run at the proper time. At that point you can add as much test coverage as you need to have high confidence in your pipelines.

Implementing the *"best"* practices will give you additional confidence in your pipeline and encourage better programming practices for database version and API management across development teams. It will also give you higher confidence in your pipelines and enable you to avoid the cumbersome business of rolling back a database.

Happy coding!

== Concourse Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS

[[concourse]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definition. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a
sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[concourse-pipeline-step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step by step

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<concourse-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
- <<concourse-start-cf,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<concourse-fly-cf,Setup the `fly` CLI>>
- <<concourse-credentials-cf,Setup your `credentials.yml`>>
- <<concourse-build-cf,Run the seed job>>
- <<concourse-run-cf,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[concourse-fork-cf]]
==== Fork repos

There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-cf]]
==== Start Concourse and Artifactory

Concourse + Artifactory can be run locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse
./setup_docker_compose.sh
./start.sh 192.168.99.100
----

The `setup_docker_compose.sh` script should be executed once only to allow
generation of keys.

The `192.168.99.100` param is an example of an external URL of Concourse
(equal to Docker-Machine ip in this example).

Then Concourse will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.

[[concourse-deploy-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[concourse-pcfdev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF Dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` to do this.

[[concourse-fly-cf]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

If you go to Concourse website you should see sth like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you've downloaded that (and maybe added to your PATH) you can run:

[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----

If `fly` is properly installed then it should print out the version.

[[concourse-credentials-cf]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

The repo comes with `credentials-sample-cf.yml` which is set up with sample data (most credentials) are set to be applicable for PCF Dev. Copy this file to a new file `credentials.yml` (the file is added to .gitignore so don't worry that you'll push it with your passwords) and edit it as you wish. For our demo just setup:

  - `app-url` - url pointing to your forked `github-webhook` repo
  - `github-private-key` - your private key to clone / tag GitHub repos
  - `repo-with-binaries` - the IP is set to the defaults for Docker Machine. You should update it to point to your setup

If you don't have a Docker Machine just execute `./whats_my_ip.sh` script to
get an external IP that you can pass to your `repo-with-binaries` instead of the default
Docker Machine IP.

Below you can see what environment variables are required by the scripts. To the right hand side you can see the default values for PCF Dev that we set in the `credentials-sample-cf.yml`.

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]

[[concourse-build-cf]]
==== Build the pipeline

Log in (e.g. for Concourse running at `192.168.99.100` - if you don't provide any value then `localhost` is assumed). If you execute this script  (it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it's in the same folder as the script is):

[source,bash]
----
./login.sh 192.168.99.100
----

Next run the command to create the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
./set_pipeline.sh
----

Then you'll create a `github-webhook` pipeline under the `docker` alias, using the provided `credentials.yml` file.
You can override these values in exactly that order (e.g. `./set-pipeline.sh some-project another-target some-other-credentials.yml`)

[[concourse-run-cf]]

== Concourse Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[concourse]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definition. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a
sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Concourse pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<concourse-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
- <<concourse-start-k8s,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s,Setup the `fly` CLI >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s,Setup your `credentials.yml` >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-build-k8s,Setup the pipeline >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-run-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork repos

[[concourse-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-k8s]]
=== Concourse in K8S (Kubernetes)

The simplest way to deploy Concourse to K8S is to use https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm].
Once you have Helm installed and your `kubectl` is pointing to the
cluster, just type this command to install the Concourse cluster in your K8S cluster.

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install stable/concourse --name concourse
----

Once it's done you'll see the following output

[source,bash]
----
1. Concourse can be accessed:

  * Within your cluster, at the following DNS name at port 8080:

    concourse-web.default.svc.cluster.local

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands in the same shell:

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080

2. Login with the following credentials

  Username: concourse
  Password: concourse
----

Just follow these steps and log in to Concourse under http://127.0.0.1:8080.

==== Deploying Artifactory to K8S

We can use Helm also to deploy Artifactory to K8S

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name artifactory --set artifactory.image.repository=docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss stable/artifactory
----

After executing this you'll see the following output

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory Pro!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc -w nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password
----

Next, we need to set up the repositories.

First, access the Artifactory URL and log in with
user, `admin` and `password` password.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_quick_setup.png[title="Click on the `Quick Setup`"]

Then, click on the Maven setup and click `Create`.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_maven_repo.png[title="Create the `Maven` Repository"]

[[concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

[[fly]] If you go to Concourse website you should see sth like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you've downloaded that (and maybe added to your PATH) you can run:

[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----

If `fly` is properly installed then it should print out the version.

[[concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

There is a sample credentials file called `credentials-sample-k8s.yml`
prepared for `k8s`. You can use it as a base for your `credentials.yml`.

To allow the Concourse worker's spawned container to connect to
Kubernetes cluster you will need to pass the CA contents and the
auth token.

To get the contents of CA for GCE just execute

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
----

To get the token just type:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
----

Set that value under `paas-test-client-token`, `paas-stage-client-token` and `paas-prod-client-token`

[[concourse-pipeline-build-k8s]]
==== Build the pipeline

After running Concourse you should get the following output in your terminal

[source,bash]
----
$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
$ echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse
----

Log in (e.g. for Concourse running at `127.0.0.1` - if you don't provide any value then `localhost` is assumed). If you execute this script  (it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it's in the same folder as the script is):

[source,bash]
----
$ fly -t k8s login -c http://localhost:8080 -u concourse -p concourse
----

Next run the command to create the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./set_pipeline.sh github-webhook k8s credentials-k8s.yml
----

[[concourse-pipeline-run-k8s]]

== Jenkins Pipeline (Common)

In this section we will present the common setup of Jenkins for any platform.
We will also provide answers to most frequently asked questions.

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
.
â”œâ”€â”€ declarative-pipeline
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy
â”œâ”€â”€ jobs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy

â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ main
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ test
----

In the `declarative-pipeline` you can find a definition of a `Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy` declarative
pipeline. It's used together with the Blueocean UI.

In the `jobs` folder you have all the seed jobs that will generate pipelines.

- `jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Pipeline plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample.groovy` - is an opinionated implementation using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample_view.groovy` - builds the views for the pipelines

In the `seed` folder you have the `init.groovy` file which is executed when Jenkins starts.
That way we can configure most of Jenkins options for you (adding credentials, JDK etc.).
`jenkins_pipeline.groovy` contains logic to build a seed job (that way you don't have to even click that
job - we generate it for you). Under the `k8s` folder there are all the configuration
files required for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

In the `src` folder you have production and test classes needed for you to build your own pipeline.
Currently we have tests only cause the whole logic resides in the `jenkins_pipeline_sample` file.

=== Optional customization steps

[[jenkins_optional]] All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[deploying-infra]]
==== Deploying infra jars to a different location

It's enough to set the `ARTIFACTORY_URL` environmental variable before
executing `tools/deploy-infra.sh`. Example for deploying to Artifactory at IP `192.168.99.100`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" ./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

[[setup-settings-xml]]
==== Setup settings.xml for Maven deployment

TIP: If you want to use the default connection to the Docker version
of Artifactory you can skip this step

[[jenkins-settings]] So that `./mvnw deploy` works with Artifactory from Docker we're
already copying the missing `settings.xml` file for you. It looks more or less like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID}</id>
			<username>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_PASSWORD}</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>${DOCKER_SERVER_ID}</id>
			<username>${DOCKER_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${DOCKER_PASSWORD}</password>
			<configuration>
				<email>${DOCKER_EMAIL}</email>
			</configuration>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
----

As you can see the file is parameterized. In Maven it's enough to pass
to `./mvnw` command the proper system property to override that value. For example to pass
a different docker email you'd have to call `./mvnw -DDOCKER_EMAIL=foo@bar.com` and the value
gets updated.

If you want to use your own version of Artifactory / Nexus you have to update
the file (it's in `seed/settings.xml`).

[[setup-jenkins-env-vars]]
==== Setup Jenkins env vars

[[jenkins_env]] If you want to only play around with the demo that we've prepared you have to set *ONE* variable which is the `REPOS` variable.
That variable needs to consists of comma separated list of URLs to repositories containing business apps. So you should pass your forked repos URLs.

You can do it in the following ways:

- globally via Jenkins global env vars (then when you run the seed that variable will be taken into consideration and proper pipelines will get built)
- modify the seed job parameters (you'll have to modify the seed job configuration and change the `REPOS` property)
- provide the repos parameter when running the seed job

For the sake of simplicity let's go with the *last* option.

IMPORTANT: If you're choosing the global envs, you *HAVE* to remove the other approach
(e.g. if you set the global env for `REPOS`, please remove that property in the
seed job

[[setup-seed-props]]
===== Seed properties

Click on the seed job and pick `Build with parameters`. Then as presented in the screen below (you'll have far more properties to set) just modify the `REPOS` property by providing the comma separated list of URLs to your forks. Whatever you set will be parsed by the seed job and passed to the generated Jenkins jobs.

TIP: This is very useful when the repos you want to build differ. E.g. use
different JDK. Then some seeds can set the `JDK_VERSION` param to one version
of Java installation and the others to another one.

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed.png[]

In the screenshot we could parametrize the `REPOS` and `REPO_WITH_BINARIES` params.

[[global-envs]]
===== Global envs

IMPORTANT: This section is presented only for informational purposes - for the sake of demo you can skip it

You can add env vars (go to configure Jenkins -> Global Properties) for the following
 properties (example with defaults for PCF Dev):

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/env_vars.png[]

[[git-email]]
==== Set Git email / user

Since our pipeline is setting the git user / name explicitly for the build step
 you'd have to go to `Configure` of the build step and modify the Git name / email.
 If you want to set it globally you'll have to remove the section from the build
 step and follow these steps to set it globally.

You can set Git email / user globally like this:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/git.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Fill out Git user information"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}


[[jenkins-credentials-github]]
===== Add Jenkins credentials for GitHub

[[jenkins-credentials]] The scripts will need to access the credential in order to tag the repo.

You have to set credentials with id: `git`.

Below you can find instructions on how to set a credential (e.g. for Cloud Foundry `cf-test` credential but
remember to provide the one with id `git`).

=== Testing Jenkins scripts

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

=== How to work with Jenkins Job DSL plugin

Check out the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL[tutorial].
Provide the link to this repository in your Jenkins installation.

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).

=== Docker Image

If you would like to run the pre-configured Jenkins image somewhere other than your local machine, we
have an image you can pull and use on https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins/[DockerHub].
The `latest` tag corresponds to the latest snapshot build.  You can also find tags
corresponding to stable releases that you can use as well.

IMPORTANT: The Jenkins docker image is setup for demo purposes. For example it has the following
system property `-Dpermissive-script-security.enabled=no_security` that disables script
security. *YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT ON PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING*.

// remove::start[CF]
[[jenkins-pipeline-cf]]
== Jenkins Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-cf,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-cf,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-cf,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-cf]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-cf]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-cf]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-cf]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

Instead of the Git username and password parameters you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
if you prefer to use the key-based authentication with your Git repositories.

[[deploy-infra-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-cf]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[start-pcf-dev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-cf-resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins-pcfdev-cf]] You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF Dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-cf]]
==== Run the seed job

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.

==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics`.

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on the *deploy previous version to stage* due to missing jar,
that means that you've forgotten to clear the tags in your repo. Typically that's due to the fact that
you've removed the Artifactory volume with deployed JAR whereas a tag in the repo is still pointing there.

blocking an executor when manual step is required. That means that you'll run out of executors
pretty fast. You can check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[issue] for

[[optional-steps-cf]]
=== Jenkins Cloud Foundry customization

 All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
== Jenkins Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-k8s,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-k8s,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-minikube-k8s,Start Minikube (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-k8s,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-k8s]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-k8s]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg yourDockerRegistryOrganization yourDockerRegistryUsername yourDockerRegistryPassword yourDockerRegistryEmail
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

Instead of the Git username and password parameters you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
if you prefer to use the key-based authentication with your Git repositories.

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default we will
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline will be able
to push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built,
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images will be built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process will be reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That's why you don't have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster the driver
will not be shared by the Jenkins workers so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

[[jenkins-seed-k8s]]
==== Run the seed job

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.

|======================

=== Preparing to connect to GCE

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using GCE

In order to use GCE we need to have `gcloud` running. If you already have the
CLI installed, skip this step. If not just execute to have the CLI
downloaded and an installer started

```bash
$ ./tools/k8s-helper.sh download-gcloud
```

Next, configure `gcloud`. Execute `gcloud init` and log in
to your cluster. You will get redirected to a login page, pick the
proper Google account and log in.

Pick an existing project or create a new one.

Go to your platform page (click on `Container Engine`) in GCP and connect to your cluster

```bash
$ CLUSTER_NAME=...
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ PROJECT_NAME=...
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_NAME}
$ kubectl proxy
```

The Kubernetes dashboard will be running at `http://localhost:8001/ui/`.

We'll need a Persistent Disk for our Jenkins installation. Let's create it

```bash
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ gcloud compute disks create --size=200GB --zone=${ZONE} sc-pipelines-jenkins-disk
```

Since the disk got created now we need to format it. You can check out
the instructions on how to do it here - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting

=== Connecting to a Kubo or GCE cluster

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using Kubo or GCE

In this section a description of steps required to deploy Jenkins and
Artifactory to a Kubernetes cluster deployed via Kubo.

TIP: To see the dashboard just do `kubectl proxy` and access `localhost:8081/ui`

- Log in to the cluster
- Deploy Jenkins and Artifactory to the cluster
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-vsphere` for a cluster deployed on VSphere
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-gce` for a cluster deployed to GCE
- Forward the ports so that you can access the Jenkins UI from your local machine

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=default
$ JENKINS_POD=jenkins-1430785859-nfhx4
$ LOCAL_PORT=32044
$ CONTAINER_PORT=8080
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} ${JENKINS_POD} ${LOCAL_PORT}:${CONTAINER_PORT}
```
- Go to `Credentials`, click `System` and `Global credentials`

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/kubo_credentials.png[caption="Click `Global credentials`"]

- Update `git`, `repo-with-binaries` and `docker-registry` credentials
- Run the `jenkins-pipeline-k8s-seed` seed job and fill it out with the following data
* Put `kubernetes.default:443` here (or `KUBERNETES_API:KUBERNETES_PORT`)
** `PAAS_TEST_API_URL`
** `PAAS_STAGE_API_URL`
** `PAAS_PROD_API_URL`
* Put `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` data here
** `PAAS_TEST_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CA_PATH`
* Uncheck the `Kubernetes Minikube` value
* Clear the following vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
* Set `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` value to these vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
* Set the cluster name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`
* Set the system name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_SYSTEM_NAME`
* Update the `DOCKER_EMAIL` property with your email
* Update the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_ORGANIZATION` with your Docker organization name
* If you don't want to upload the images to DockerHub update  `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`

== Kubernetes setup

=== Kubernetes CLI Installation

First you'll need to install the `kubectl` CLI.

[[kubernetes-cli-script]]
==== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/k8s-helper.sh` script to install `kubectl`. Just call

```bash
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-kubectl
```

and then the `kubectl` will get downloaded

[[kubernetes-cli-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

[[start-minikube-k8s]]
=== Kubernetes Cluster setup

We need a cluster of Kubernetes. The best choice will be https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube].

TIP: You can skip this step if you have Kubernetes cluster installed and don't
want to use Minikube The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-resources-k8s,clear some apps from Minikube and continue>>.

[[kubernetes-minikube-script]]
==== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/k8s-helper.sh` script to install `Minikube`. Just call

```bash
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-minikube
```

and then the `Minikube` cluster will get downloaded

[[kubernetes-minikube-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

Example for OSX

```bash
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Feel free to leave off the `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you would like to add minikube to your path manually.

Example for Linux

```bash
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Feel free to leave off the `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you would like to add minikube to your path manually.
Check out https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases[this page] for more info on the installation.

=== Run Minikube

Just type in `minikube start` to start Kubernetes on your local box.

To add the dashboard just execute `minikube dashboard`

=== Certificates and Workers

==== Minikube Certificates and Workers

By default if you install Minikube all the certificates get installed in your
`~/.minikube` folder. Your `kubectl` configuration under `~/.kube/config` will also
get updated to use Minikube.

==== Manual Certificates and Workers Setup

IMPORTANT: If you just want to run the default, demo setup you can skip this section

To target a given Kubernetes instance one needs to pass around Certificate Authority
key and also user keys.

You can read more about the instructions on how to generate those keys https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/openssl.html[here].
 Generally speaking if you have a Kubernetes installation (e.g. `minikube`) this step
 has already been done for you. Time to reuse those keys on the workers.

Extracted from the https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/configure-kubectl.html[official docs].

Configure kubectl to connect to the target cluster using the following commands, replacing several values as indicated:

- Replace `${MASTER_HOST}` with the master node address or name used in previous steps
- Replace `${CA_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `ca.pem` created in previous steps
- Replace `${ADMIN_KEY}` with the absolute path to the `admin-key.pem` created in previous steps
- Replace `${ADMIN_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `admin.pem` created in previous steps

```
$ kubectl config set-cluster default-cluster --server=https://${MASTER_HOST} --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-credentials default-admin --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT} --client-key=${ADMIN_KEY} --client-certificate=${ADMIN_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-context default-system --cluster=default-cluster --user=default-admin
$ kubectl config use-context default-system
```

=== Generate Minikube namespaces

With the running Minikube cluster we need to generate namespaces. Just execute the
`./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-namespaces` to do this.
// remove::end[K8S]

// remove::start[CF]
== The demo setup (Cloud Foundry)

The demo uses 2 applications. https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook/[Github Webhook]
and https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github analytics code]. Below you can
see an image of how these application communicate with each other.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo.png[caption="The overview of the demo: ", title="Github Webhook listens to HTTP calls and sends a message to Github Analytics"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

For the demo scenario we have two applications. `Github Analytics` and `Github Webhook`.
Let's imagine a case where Github is emitting events via HTTP. `Github Webhook` has
an API that could register to such hooks and receive those messages. Once this happens
 `Github Webhook` sends a message by RabbitMQ to a channel. `Github Analytics` is
 listening to those messages and stores them in a MySQL database.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo_metrics.png[caption="Gathering metrics: ", title="Github Analytics exposes metrics that are polled by Prometheus"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

`Github Analytics` has its KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) monitored. In the case
of that application the KPI is number of issues.

image::{demo-root-docs}/demo_alerting.png[caption="Alerting over metrics: ", title="Grafana alerts Slack over Prometheus metrics"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

Let's assume that if we go below the threshold of X issues then an alert should be
sent to Slack.

=== Deploying production applications to PCF Dev

In the real world scenario we wouldn't want to automatically provision services like
RabbitMQ, MySQL or Eureka each time we deploy a new application to production. Typically
production is provisioned manually (using automated solutions). In our case, before
you deploy to production you can provision the `pcfdev-prod` space using the
 `cf-helper.sh`. Just call

[source,bash]
----
$ ./cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra
----

What will happen is that the CF CLI will login to PCF Dev, target `pcfdev-prod` space,
setup RabbitMQ (under `rabbitmq-github` name), MySQL (under `mysql-github-analytics` name)
and Eureka (under `github-eureka` name).

=== Running Prometheus on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/prometheus-on-PCF[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Go to https://prometheus.io/download/ and download linux binary. Then call:

```
cf push sc-pipelines-prometheus -b binary_buildpack -c './prometheus -web.listen-address=:8080' -m 64m
```

Also `localhost:9090` in `prometheus.yml` should be `localhost:8080`.

The file should look like this to work with the demo setup (change `github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io`
to your `github-analytics` installation).

```yml
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
      monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']

  - job_name: 'demo-app'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['github-analytics-sc-pipelines.cfapps.io']
```

A deployed version for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo is available https://sc-pipelines-prometheus.cfapps.io/[here]

=== Running Grafana on CF

You can check out https://github.com/making/cf-grafana[Toshiaki Maki's code] on how to automate Prometheus installation on CF.

Download tarball from https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=linux
Next set `http_port = 8080` in `conf/default.ini`. Then call

```
cf push sc-pipelines-grafana -b binary_buildpack -c './bin/grafana-server web' -m 64m
```

The demo is using Grafana Dashboard with ID `2471`.

Next, let's create the prometheus installation with the predefined values.

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name sc-pipelines-prometheus stable/prometheus -f values.yaml
----

Then you should see the following output

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
The Prometheus server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the Prometheus server URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9090


The Prometheus alertmanager can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-alertmanager.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the Alertmanager URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=alertmanager" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9093


The Prometheus PushGateway can be accessed via port 9091 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-pushgateway.default.svc.cluster.local


Get the PushGateway URL by running these commands in the same shell:
  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=prometheus,component=pushgateway" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 9093

For more information on running Prometheus, visit:
https://prometheus.io/

=== Running Grafana on Kubernetes

Use Helm to install Grafana

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name sc-pipelines-grafana stable/grafana
----

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
1. Get your 'admin' user password by running:

   kubectl get secret --namespace default sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.grafana-admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo

2. The Grafana server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:

   sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana.default.svc.cluster.local

   Get the Grafana URL to visit by running these commands in the same shell:

     export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=sc-pipelines-grafana-grafana,component=grafana" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
     kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 3000

3. Login with the password from step 1 and the username: admin
----

Perform the aforementioned steps and add the Grafana's datasource
as Prometheus with URL `http://sc-pipelines-prometheus-prometheus-server.default.svc.cluster.local`

You can pick the dashboard via the Grafana ID (2471). This is the
default dashboard for the Spring Cloud Pipelines demo apps.

If you have both apps (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics`) running on production
we can now trigger the messages. Download the JSON with a sample request
from https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/github-webhook-kubernetes/blob/master/src/test/resources/github-webhook-input/hook-created.json[the github-webhook repository].
Next, pick one of the `github-webhook` pods and forward its port
locally to a port `9876` like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=sc-pipelines-prod $( kubectl get pods --namespace=sc-pipelines-prod | grep github-webhook | head -1 | awk '{print $1}' ) 9876:8080
----

next send a couple of requests (more than 4).

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:9876/ -d @path/to/issue-created.json \
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
----

Then if you check out Grafana you'll see that you went above the
threshold.

== Building the project

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
.
â”œâ”€â”€ common
â”œâ”€â”€ concourse
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”œâ”€â”€ docs-sources
â””â”€â”€ jenkins
----

In the `common` folder you can find all the Bash scripts containing the pipeline logic. These
scripts are reused by both Concourse and Jenkins pipelines.

In the `concourse` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Concourse demo.

In the `dist` folder you can find the packaged sources of the project. Since the package
contains no tests or documentation it's extremely small and can be used in the pipelines.

In the `docs` folder you have the whole generated documentation of the project.

In the `docs-source` folder you have the sources required to generate the documentation.

In the `jenkins` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Jenkins demo.

=== Prerequisites

As prerequisites you need to have http://www.shellcheck.net/[shellcheck],
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats[bats], https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]
 and https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[ruby] installed. If you're on a Linux
 machine then `bats` and `shellcheck` will be installed for you.

To install the required software on Linux just type the following commands

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y ruby jq
----

If you're on a Mac then just execute these commands to install the missing software

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install jq
$ brew install ruby
$ brew install bats
$ brew install shellcheck
----

=== Bats submodules

To make `bats` work properly we needed to attach Git submodules. To have them
initialized either clone with appropriate command

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
----

or if you have already cloned the project and are just pulling changes

[source,bash]
----
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
----

If you forget about this step, then Gradle will execute these steps for you.

=== Build and test

Once you have installed all the prerequisites you can execute

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew clean build
----

to build and test the project.

=== Generate docs

To generate docs just run

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew generateDocs
----

=== Distributions

Spring Cloud Pipelines has a lot of tests, including Git repositories. Those
and the documentation weigh a lot. That's why under the `dist` folder we
publish `zip` and `tar.gz` distributions of sources without tests and documentation.
Whenever we release a distribution we attach a `VERSION` file to it that contains
build and SCM information (e.g. build time, revision). To skip the distribution generation
just pass the `skipDist` property

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build -PskipDist
----


=== Making a release

It's enough to execute the `release` task that will automatically test the project,
build the distributions, change the versions, build the docs, upload them to Spring Cloud Static,
tag the repo and then revert the changed versions back to default.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew release -PnewVersion=1.0.0.RELEASE
----

== Releasing the project

=== Publishing A Docker Image

When doing a release you also need to push a Docker image to Dockerhub.
From the project root, run the following commands replacing `<version>` with the
version of the release.

[source,bash]
----
$ docker login
$ docker build -t springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version> ./jenkins
$ docker push springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version>
----

== CI Server worker prerequisites

Spring Cloud Pipelines uses Bash scripts extensively. Below you can find the list of software
that needs to be installed on a CI server worker for the build to pass.

TIP: In the demo setup all of these libraries are already installed.

[source,bash]
----
 apt-get -y install \
    bash \
    git \
    tar \
    zip \
    curl \
    ruby \
    wget \
    unzip \
    python \
    jq
----

IMPORTANT: In the Jenkins case you will also need `bats` and `shellcheck`. They are not
presented in the list since the installed versions by Linux distributions might be old.
That's why this project's Gradle tasks will download latest versions of both libraries
for you.

// remove::start[CONCOURSE]
[[concourse-faq]]
== Concourse FAQ

=== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! Just change the `app-url` in `credentials.yml`!

=== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions. Check out the documentation to see
what those decisions are.

=== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written in
Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash scripts without changing the
whole pipeline. https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/tree/master/common/src/main/bash[You can check out the scripts here.]

Furthermore, if you only want to customize a particular function under `common/src/main/bash`, you can provide your own
function under `common/src/main/bash/<some custom identifier>` where `<some custom identifier>` is equal to the value of
the `CUSTOM_SCRIPT_IDENTIFIER` environment variable. It defaults to `custom`.

=== I ran out of resources!! (PCF Dev)

[[resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `./tools/cf-helper.sh kill-all-apps` that will remove
all demo-related apps deployed to PCF Dev.

=== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----

=== Can I see the output of a job from the terminal?

Yes! Assuming that pipeline name is `github-webhook` and job name is `build-and-upload` you can running

[source,bash]
----
fly watch --job github-webhook/build-and-upload -t docker
----

=== I clicked the job and it's constantly pending...

Don't worry... most likely you've just forgotten to click the `play` button to
unpause the pipeline. Click to the top left, expand the list of pipelines and click
the `play` button next to `github-webhook`.

Another problem that might occur is that you need to have the `version` branch.
Concourse will wait for the `version` branch to appear in your repo. So in order for
the pipeline to start ensure that when doing some git operations you haven't
forgotten to create / copy the `version` branch too.

=== The route is already in use (CF)

If you play around with Jenkins / Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied

[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io
Binding github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io to github-webhook...
FAILED
The route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io is already in use.
----

Just delete the routes

[source,bash]
----
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n stubrunner-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-prod
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-prod
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh delete-routes`

=== I'm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars

Most likely you've forgotten to update your local `settings.xml` with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml`>>.

=== `version` resource is broken

When I click on it it looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
resource script '/opt/resource/check []' failed: exit status 128

stderr:
Identity added: /tmp/git-resource-private-key (/tmp/git-resource-private-key)
Cloning into '/tmp/git-resource-repo-cache'...
warning: Could not find remote branch version to clone.
fatal: Remote branch version not found in upstream origin
----

That means that your repo doesn't have the `version` branch. Please
set it up.
// remove::end[CONCOURSE]

// remove::start[JENKINS]
== Jenkins FAQ

Below you can find the answers to most frequently asked questions.

[[jenkins_faq]]
=== Pipeline version contains ${PIPELINE_VERSION}

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----

To fix it you have to do exactly what the warning suggests... Also ensure that the `Groovy token macro processing`
checkbox is set.

=== Pipeline version is not passed to the build

You can see that the Jenkins version is properly set but in the build version is still snapshot and
the `echo "${PIPELINE_VERSION}"` doesn't print anything.

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.

----

To fix it you have to do exactly what the warning suggests...

=== The build times out with `pipeline.sh` info

Docker compose, docker compose, docker compose... The problem is that for some reason, only in Docker, the execution of
Java hangs. But it hangs randomly and only the first time you try to execute the pipeline.

The solution to this is to run the pipeline again. If once it suddenly, magically passes then
it will pass for any subsequent build.

Another thing that you can try is to run it with plain Docker. Maybe that will help.

=== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! you can pass `REPOS` variable with comma separated list of
`project_name$project_url` format. If you don't provide the PROJECT_NAME the
repo name will be extracted and used as the name of the project.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `github-analytics` and `github-webhook`.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`foo$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,bar$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/atom-feed`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `foo` for `github-analytics`
and `bar` for `github-webhook`.

=== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions like:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- For Maven:
    * usage of Maven Wrapper
    * artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
    * `stubrunner.ids` property to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded
    * running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
    * running end to end tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile
- For Gradle (in the `github-analytics` application check the `gradle/pipeline.gradle` file):
    * usage of Gradlew Wrapper
    * `deploy` task for artifacts deployment
    * running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` task
    * running end to end tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` task
    * `groupId` task to retrieve group id
    * `artifactId` task to retrieve artifact id
    * `currentVersion` task to retrieve the current version
    * `stubIds` task to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

=== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written
in Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash
scripts without changing the whole pipeline.

=== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

[[jenkins_tags]] You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----

=== I want to provide a different JDK version

- by default we assume that you have jdk with id `jdk8` configured
- if you want a different one just override `JDK_VERSION` env var and point to the proper one

TIP: The docker image comes in with Java installed at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
You can go to `Global Tools` and create a JDK with `jdk8` id and JAVA_HOME
 pointing to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`

To change the default one just follow these steps:

{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/global_tool.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Global Tool'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk.png[caption="Step 4: ", title="Fill out JDK Installation with path to your JDK"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

And that's it!

[[groovy-token-macro]]
=== Enable Groovy Token Macro Processing

With scripted that but if you needed to this manually then this is how to do it:

=== I want deployment to stage and prod be automatic

No problem, just set the property / env var to true

- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_STAGE` to automatically deploy to stage
- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` to automatically deploy to prod

=== I don't want to test API compativility

No problem, just set the `API_COMPATIBILITY_STEP_REQUIRED` env variable
to `false` and rerun the seed (you can pick it from the seed
job's properties too).

=== I can't tag the repo!

When you get sth like this:

[source,bash]
----
19:01:44 stderr: remote: Invalid username or password.

----

most likely you've passed a wrong password. Check the <<jenkins_credentials,credentials>> section
on how to update your credentials.

=== I'm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars

Most likely you've forgotten to update your local `settings.xml` with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<jenkins_settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml`>>.

=== Signing Artifacts

In some cases it may be required that when performing a release that the artifacts be signed
before pushing them to the repository.
To do this you will need to import your GPG keys into the Docker image running Jenkins.
This can be done by placing a file called `public.key` containing your public key
and a file called `private.key` containing your private key in the `seed` directory.
These keys will be imported by the `init.groovy` script that is run when Jenkins starts.

=== Using SSH keys for git

The seed job checks if an env variable `GIT_USE_SSH_KEY` is set to `true`. If that's the case
then env variable `GIT_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID` will be chosen as the one that contains the
id of the credential that contains SSH private key. By default `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID` will be picked
as the one that contains username and password to connect to git.

You can set these values in the seed job by filling out the form / toggling a checkbox.

=== Deploy to stage fails and doesn't redeploy a service (Kubernetes)

There can be a number of reason but remember that for stage we
assume that a sequence of manual steps need to be performed. We don't
redeploy any existing services cause most likely you deliberately
have set it up in that way or the other. If in the logs of your application
you can see that you can't connect to a service, first ensure that
the service is forwarding traffic to a pod. Next if that's not the case
please delete the service and re-run the step in the pipeline. That way
Spring Cloud Pipelines will redeploy the service and the underlying pods.

=== I ran out of resources!! (Cloud Foundry)

[jenkins-cf-resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `./tools/cf-helper.sh kill-all-apps` that will remove all demo-related apps
deployed to PCF Dev.

=== Deploying to test / stage / prod fails - error finding space (Cloud Foundry)

If you receive a similar exception:

[source,bash]
----
20:26:18 API endpoint:   https://api.local.pcfdev.io (API version: 2.58.0)
20:26:18 User:           user
20:26:18 Org:            pcfdev-org
20:26:18 Space:          No space targeted, use 'cf target -s SPACE'
20:26:18 FAILED
20:26:18 Error finding space pcfdev-test
20:26:18 Space pcfdev-test not found
----

It means that you've forgotten to <<jenkins_pcfdev,create the spaces>> in your PCF Dev installation.

=== The route is already in use (Cloud Foundry)

If you play around with Jenkins / Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied

[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io
Binding github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io to github-webhook...
FAILED
The route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io is already in use.
----

Just delete the routes

[source,bash]
----
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n stubrunner-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-prod
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-prod
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh delete-routes`

=== How to execute helper scripts against a real CF instance I'm logged into (Cloud Foundry)

Assuming that you're already logged into the cluster it's enough to run the
helper script with the `REUSE_CF_LOGIN=true` env variable. Example:

```bash
REUSE_CF_LOGIN=true ./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra
```

This script will create the mysql db, rabbit mq service, download and deploy Eureka
to the space and organization you're logged into.
