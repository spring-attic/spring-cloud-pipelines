<p><strong>Build</strong> environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It&#8217;s a CI / CD tool worker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Test</strong> is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It doesn’t
resemble production, we can&#8217;t be sure of it&#8217;s state (which application is deployed there
and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stage</strong> is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely applications
 are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
 Typically databases there are filled up with (obfuscated) production data. Most
 often this environment is a single, shared one between many teams. In other
 words in order to run some performance, user acceptance tests you have to block
 and wait until the environment is free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Prod</strong> is a production environment where we want our tested applications to be deployed
for our customers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tests">Tests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Unit tests</strong> - tests that are executed on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases / HTTP server stubs etc. take place. Generally speaking your application should
 have plenty of these to have fast feedback if your features are working fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Integration tests</strong> - tests that are executed on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in memory databases / HTTP server stubs take place. According to the test
pyramid, in most cases you should have not too many of these kind of tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Smoke tests</strong> - tests that are executed on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain most money from e.g. 5 features then you could write smoke tests
 for those 5 features. As you can see we&#8217;re talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
 the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
 executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>End to end tests</strong> - tests that are executed on a system composing of multiple applications.
The idea of these tests is to check if the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, resources to maintain such an environment
and that often those tests are unreliable (due to many different moving pieces like network
database etc.) you should have a handful of those tests. Only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
don&#8217;t even want to do those and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting you can quickly react when your deployed application
is not behaving properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Performance testing</strong> - tests executed on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle big load of input. In case of our opinionated pipeline
 these tests could be executed either on test (against stubbed environment) or
  stage (against the whole system)</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_testing_against_stubs">Testing against stubs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we go into details of the flow let&#8217;s take a look at the following example.</p>

<img src="img/intro/monolith.png" alt="monolith">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When having only a handful of applications, performing end to end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective it&#8217;s maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective it&#8217;s nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case of microservices the scale starts to be a problem:</p>

<div class="imageblock">

<img src="img/intro/many_microservices.png" alt="many microservices">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Many microservices deployed in different versions</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The questions arise:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If I queue deployments people will have to wait for hours to have their tests ran - that can be a problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To remove that issue I can have an environment per microservice</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who will pay the bills (imagine 100 microservices - each having each own environment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who will support each of those environments?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
them up and running for the whole day?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If I have development versions then I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
That can lead to exceptions on production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I test against production versions then I&#8217;ll never be able to test against a feature under development
anytime before deployment to production.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to&#8230;&#8203; not do end to end tests.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 5. Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we stub out all the dependencies of our application then most of the problems presented above
disappear. There is no need to start and setup infrastructure required by the dependant
microservices. That way the testing setup looks like this:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 6. We&#8217;re testing microservices in isolation</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of <a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html">Spring Cloud Contract</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to deploy dependant services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stubs used for the tests ran on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (check <a href="http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html">Spring Cloud Contract</a> for more information)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&#8217;t have many slow tests running on a deployed application - thus the pipeline gets executed much faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&#8217;t have to queue deployments - we&#8217;re testing in isolation thus pipelines don&#8217;t interfere with each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&#8217;t have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It brings however the following challenges:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>No end to end tests before production - you don&#8217;t have the full certainty that a feature is working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First time the applications will talk in a real way will be on production</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like every solution it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
 allows you to configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_general_view">General view</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>test the application in isolation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>test the backwards compatibility of the application in order to roll it back if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow testing of the packaged app in a deployed environment</p>

<li>
<p>allow user acceptance tests / performance tests in a deployed environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow deployment to production</p>

<p>For the demo purposes we&#8217;re providing Docker Compose setup with Artifactory and Concourse / Jenkins tools.
Regardless of the picked CD application for the pipeline to pass one needs a Cloud Foundry instance (for example
<a href="https://run.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Web Services</a> or <a href="https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev">PCF Dev</a>) and the
infrastructure applications deployed to the JAR hosting application (for the demo we&#8217;re providing Artifactory).
The infrastructure applications are <code>Eureka</code> for Service Discovery and <code>Stub Runner Boot</code> for running
Spring Cloud Contract stubs.</p>

<p>In this step we&#8217;re generating a version of the pipeline, next we&#8217;re

</li>
<li>
<p>deploying <code>Eureka</code> infrastructure application to Cloud Foundry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we&#8217;re uploading it to Cloud Foundry. We want the application
to run in isolation (be surrounded by stubs). Currently due to port constraints in Cloud Foundry
we cannot run multiple stubbed HTTP services in the cloud so to fix this issue we&#8217;re running
the application with <code>smoke</code> Spring profile on which you can stub out all HTTP calls to return
a mocked response</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the application is using a database then it gets upgraded at this point via Flyway, Liquibase
or any other tool once the application gets started</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the project&#8217;s Maven or Gradle build we&#8217;re extracting <code>stubrunner.ids</code> property that contains
all the <code>groupId:artifactId:version:classifier</code> notation of dependant projects for which
the stubs should be downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then we&#8217;re uploading <code>Stub Runner Boot</code> and pass the extracted <code>stubrunner.ids</code> to it. That way
we&#8217;ll have a running application in Cloud Foundry that will download all the necessary stubs
of our application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the checked out code we&#8217;re running the tests available under the <code>smoke</code> profile. In the
case of <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/">GitHub Analytics</a> application
we&#8217;re triggering a message from the <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook">GitHub Webhook</a>
application&#8217;s stub, that is sent via RabbitMQ to GitHub Analytics. Then we&#8217;re checking if
message count has increased. You can check those tests <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/blob/master/src/test/java/smoke/IntegrationTests.java">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once the tests pass we&#8217;re searching for the last production release. Once the application
is deployed to production we&#8217;re tagging it with <code>prod/${version}</code> tag. If there is no such tag
(there was no production release) there will be no rollback tests executed. If there was
a production release the tests will get executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assuming that there was a production release we&#8217;re checking out the code corresponding to that
release (we&#8217;re checking out the tag), we&#8217;re downloading the appropriate fat jar and we&#8217;re uploading
it to Cloud Foundry. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> the <em>old</em> jar is running against the <strong>NEW</strong> version of the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we&#8217;re running the <em>old</em> <code>smoke</code> tests against the freshly deployed application surrounded by stubs.
If those tests pass then we have a high probability that the application is backwards compatible</p>

<p>Sure! It&#8217;s open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written in
Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash scripts without changing the
whole pipeline. <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/tree/master/common/src/main/bash">You can check out the scripts here.</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, if you only want to customize a particular function under <code>common/src/main/bash</code>, you can provide your own
