## This file is complementary to the JFrog Artifactory startup wizard, and may be used to specify the initial basic
## settings for a new Artifactory installation, namely:
## * License Key(s)
## * Base URL
## * Proxy
## * Default repositories
##
##
## HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
##
## To import these settings when bootstrapping Artifactory, save this file as artifactory.config.import.yml under Artifactory’s /etc folder
## Artifactory will load this file if all of the following conditions are met:
## - no repositories have been created
## - a proxy has not been set up, or you did set up a proxy externally, but did not configure proxy setup through this file
## - the base URL has not been set up, or you did set up the base URL externally, but did not configure the base URL setup through this file
## - Artifactory has not been activated with a license, or Artifactory has been activated with a license, and you did not specify a license in this file
##
## To have any of these parameters automatically configured when you bootstrap an Artifactory instance using this file,
## simply uncomment the relevant sections below, and where required, provide values.
