== Concourse Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter, we assume that you deploy your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS.

[[concourse]]
The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definitions. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and an
opinionated sample pipeline one that you can use in your company.

There following projects take part in the  `microservice setup` for this demo.

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics]: The app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]: Project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka]: Simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics and uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[concourse-pipeline-step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step-by-step

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible by using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<concourse-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
. <<concourse-start-cf,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
. <<concourse-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
. <<concourse-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
. <<concourse-fly-cf,Setup the `fly` CLI>>
. <<concourse-credentials-cf,Setup your `credentials.yml`>>
. <<concourse-build-cf,Build the Pipeline>>
. <<concourse-run-cf,Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline>>

[[concourse-fork-cf]]
==== Fork Repositories

Four applications compose the pipeline

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following repositories, because only then can you tag and push the tag to the repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-cf]]
==== Start Concourse and Artifactory

You can run Concourse + Artifactory locally. To do so, run the
`start.sh` script from this repository. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse
./setup_docker_compose.sh
./start.sh 192.168.99.100
----
====

The `setup_docker_compose.sh` script should be run only once, to allow
generation of keys.

The `192.168.99.100` param is an example of an external URL of Concourse
(equal to the Docker-Machine IP in this example).

Then Concourse runs on port `8080`, and Artifactory runs on `8081`.

[[concourse-deploy-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

When Artifactory is running, run the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.
The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----
====

As a result, both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos are cloned, built,
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[concourse-pcfdev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and do not want to use PCF Dev.
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
If that happens, <<resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

You have to download and start PCF Dev, as described  https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[here.]

The default credentials for PCF Dev are as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----
====

You can start the PCF Dev as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----
====

You must create three separate spaces, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----
====

You can also run the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` script to create the spaces.

[[concourse-fly-cf]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

If you go to the Concourse website, you should see something resembling the following image:

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you download that (and maybe, depending on your OS, add it to your PATH) you can run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----
====

If `fly` is properly installed, it should print out the version.

[[concourse-credentials-cf]]
==== Set up Your `credentials.yml` File

The repository comes with `credentials-sample-cf.yml`, which is set up with sample data (mostly credentials) that are applicable for PCF Dev. Copy this file to a new file called `credentials.yml` (the file is added to `.gitignore` so that you cannot push it with your passwords) and edit it as you wish. For our demo, set up the following:

* `app-url`: URL pointing to your forked `github-webhook` repository.
* `github-private-key`: Your private key to clone and tag GitHub repositorys.
* `repo-with-binaries`: The IP is set to the defaults for Docker Machine. You should update it to point to your setup.

If you do not have a Docker Machine, run th `./whats_my_ip.sh` script to
get an external IP that you can pass to your `repo-with-binaries`, instead of the default
Docker Machine IP.

The following table describes the environment variables required by the scripts:

[frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Property Name  | Property Description | Default value
|`PAAS_TEST_API_URL` | The URL to the CF Api for TEST env| `api.local.pcfdev.io`
|`PAAS_STAGE_API_URL` | The URL to the CF Api for STAGE env | `api.local.pcfdev.io`
|`PAAS_PROD_API_URL` | The URL to the CF Api for PROD env | `api.local.pcfdev.io`
|`PAAS_TEST_ORG`    | Name of the org for the test env | `pcfdev-org`
|`PAAS_TEST_SPACE_PREFIX`  | Prefix of the name of the CF space for the test env to which the app name will be appended | `sc-pipelines-test`
|`PAAS_STAGE_ORG`   | Name of the org for the stage env | `pcfdev-org`
|`PAAS_STAGE_SPACE` | Name of the space for the stage env | `sc-pipelines-stage`
|`PAAS_PROD_ORG`   | Name of the org for the prod env | `pcfdev-org`
|`PAAS_PROD_SPACE` | Name of the space for the prod env | `sc-pipelines-prod`
|`REPO_WITH_BINARIES_FOR_UPLOAD` | URL to repo with the deployed jars | `http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
|`M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID` | The id of server from Maven settings.xml | `artifactory-local`
|`PAAS_HOSTNAME_UUID` | Additional suffix for the route. In a shared environment the default routes can be already taken |
|`BUILD_OPTIONS` | Additional options you would like to pass to the Maven / Gradle build |
|======================

The right column shows the default values for PCF Dev that we set in the `credentials-sample-cf.yml`. `PAAS_HOSTNAME_UUID` and `BUILD_OPTIONS` have no default values.

[[concourse-build-cf]]
==== Build the Pipeline

Log in (for example, for a Concourse instance running at `192.168.99.100` -- if you do not provide any value, `localhost` is assumed). If you run the login script, it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it is in the same folder as the script. The following example shows how to specify an IP address for the login script:

====
[source,bash]
----
./login.sh 192.168.99.100
----
====

Next, run the command to create the pipeline, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
./set_pipeline.sh
----
====

Then you can create a `github-webhook` pipeline under the `docker` alias, using the provided `credentials.yml` file.
You can override these values in exactly that order (for example `./set-pipeline.sh some-project another-target some-other-credentials.yml`)

[[concourse-run-cf]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline

The following images show the various steps involved in running the `github-webhook` pipeline:

== Concourse Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter, we assume that you deploy your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[concourse]]
The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definitions. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and an
opinionated sample pipeline that you can use in your company.

The following projects take part in the `microservice setup` for this demo:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics]: The application that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]: Project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka]: Simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics and uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step-by-step

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible by using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<concourse-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
. <<concourse-start-k8s,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
. <<concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s,Setup the `fly` CLI >>
. <<concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s,Setup your `credentials.yml` >>
. <<concourse-pipeline-build-k8s,Setup the pipeline >>
. <<concourse-pipeline-run-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork Repositories

[[concourse-fork-k8s]]
Four applications compose the pipeline:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following repositories, because only then can you tag and push the tag to the repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-k8s]]
=== Concourse in K8S (Kubernetes)

The simplest way to deploy Concourse to K8S is to use https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm].
Once you have Helm installed and your `kubectl` is pointing to the
cluster, run the following command to install the Concourse cluster in your K8S cluster:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ helm install stable/concourse --name concourse
----
====

Once the script is done, you should see the following output

====
[source,bash]
----
1. Concourse can be accessed:

  * Within your cluster, at the following DNS name at port 8080:

    concourse-web.default.svc.cluster.local

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands in the same shell:

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080

2. Login with the following credentials

  Username: concourse
  Password: concourse
----
====

Follow the steps and log in to Concourse under http://127.0.0.1:8080.

==== Deploying Artifactory to K8S

You can use Helm also to deploy Artifactory to K8S, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name artifactory --set artifactory.image.repository=docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss stable/artifactory
----
====

After you run this command, you should see the following output:

====
[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory Pro!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc -w nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password
----
====

Next, you need to set up the repositories.

First, access the Artifactory URL and log in with
a user name of `admin` and a password of `password`.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_quick_setup.png[title="Click on Quick Setup"]

Then, click on Maven setup and click `Create`.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_maven_repo.png[title="Create the `Maven` Repository"]

[[concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

[[fly]] If you go to the Concourse website you should see something resembling the following:

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you download that (and maybe added it to your PATH, depending on your OS) you can run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----
====

If `fly` is properly installed, it should print out the version.

[[concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

We made a sample credentials file called `credentials-sample-k8s.yml`
prepared for `k8s`. You can use it as a base for your `credentials.yml`.

To allow the Concourse worker's spawned container to connect to the
Kubernetes cluster, you must pass the CA contents and the
auth token.

To get the contents of CA for GCE, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
----
====

To get the auth token, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
----
====

Set that value under `paas-test-client-token`, `paas-stage-client-token`, and `paas-prod-client-token`

[[concourse-pipeline-build-k8s]]
==== Build the pipeline

After running Concourse, you should get the following output in your terminal:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
$ echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse
----
====

Log in (for example, for Concourse running at `127.0.0.1` -- if you do not provide any value, `localhost` is assumed). If you run this script, it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or that it is in the same folder as the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ fly -t k8s login -c http://localhost:8080 -u concourse -p concourse
----
====

Next, run the following command to create the pipeline:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./set_pipeline.sh github-webhook k8s credentials-k8s.yml
----
====

[[concourse-pipeline-run-k8s]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline
