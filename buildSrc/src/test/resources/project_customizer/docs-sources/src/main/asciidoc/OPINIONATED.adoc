== Opinionated implementation

For the demo purposes we're providing Docker Compose setup with Artifactory and Concourse / Jenkins tools.
Regardless of the picked CD application for the pipeline to pass one needs either

- *[CLOUD FOUNDRY]* a Cloud Foundry instance (for example https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services] or https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev[PCF Dev])
- *[KUBERNETES]* a Kubernetes cluster (for example https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube])
- the infrastructure applications deployed to the JAR hosting application (for the demo we're providing Artifactory).
    - `Eureka` for Service Discovery
    - `Stub Runner Boot` for running Spring Cloud Contract stubs.

TIP: In the demos we're showing you how to first build the `github-webhook` project. That's because
the `github-analytics` needs the stubs of `github-webhook` to pass the tests. Below you'll find
references to `github-analytics` project since it contains more interesting pieces as far as testing
is concerned.

=== Build

image::{intro-root-docs}/build.png[title="Build and upload artifacts"]

In this step we're generating a version of the pipeline, next we're
 running unit, integration and contract tests. Finally we're:

- publishing a fat jar of the application
- publishing a Spring Cloud Contract jar containing stubs of the application
- *[KUBERNETES]* uploading a Docker image of the application

During this phase we're executing a `Maven` build using Maven Wrapper or a `Gradle` build using Gradle Wrapper
, with unit and integration tests. We're also *tagging* the repository with `dev/${version}` format. That way in each
subsequent step of the pipeline we're able to retrieve the tagged version. Also we know
exactly which version of the pipeline corresponds to which Git hash.

Once the artifact got built we're running API compatibility check.

- we're searching for the latest production deployment
- we're retrieving the contracts that were used by that deployment
- from the contracts we're generating API tests to see if the current implementation
is fulfilling the HTTP / messaging contracts that the current production deployment
has defined (we're checking backward compatibility of the API)

=== Test

image::{intro-root-docs}/test.png[title="Smoke test and rollback test on test environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in PaaS
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS
- downloading the fat jar from Nexus and we're uploading it to PaaS. We want the application
to run in isolation (be surrounded by stubs).

TIP: Currently due to port constraints in Cloud Foundry
we cannot run multiple stubbed HTTP services in the cloud so to fix this issue we're running
the application with `smoke` Spring profile on which you can stub out all HTTP calls to return
a mocked response

- if the application is using a database then it gets upgraded at this point via Flyway, Liquibase
or any other tool once the application gets started
- from the project's Maven or Gradle build we're extracting `stubrunner.ids` property that contains
 all the `groupId:artifactId:version:classifier` notation of dependant projects for which
 the stubs should be downloaded.
- then we're uploading `Stub Runner Boot` and pass the extracted `stubrunner.ids` to it. That way
we'll have a running application in Cloud Foundry that will download all the necessary stubs
of our application
- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `smoke` profile. In the
case of `GitHub Analytics` application we're triggering a message from the `GitHub Webhook`
application's stub, that is sent via RabbitMQ to GitHub Analytics. Then we're checking if
message count has increased.
- once the tests pass we're searching for the last production release. Once the application
is deployed to production we're tagging it with `prod/${version}` tag. If there is no such tag
(there was no production release) there will be no rollback tests executed. If there was
a production release the tests will get executed.
- assuming that there was a production release we're checking out the code corresponding to that
release (we're checking out the tag), we're downloading the appropriate artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry
or Docker image for Kubernetes) and we're uploading
it to PaaS. *IMPORTANT* the _old_ artifact is running against the *NEW* version of the database.
- we're running the _old_ `smoke` tests against the freshly deployed application surrounded by stubs.
If those tests pass then we have a high probability that the application is backwards compatible
- the default behaviour is that after all of those steps the user can manually click to deploy the
application to a stage environment

=== Stage

image::{intro-root-docs}/stage.png[title="End to end tests on stage environment"]

Here we're

- starting a RabbitMQ service in PaaS
- deploying `Eureka` infrastructure application to PaaS
- downloading the artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry or Docker image for Kubernetes)
from and we're uploading it to PaaS.

Next we have a manual step in which:

- from the checked out code we're running the tests available under the `e2e` profile. In the
case of `GitHub Analytics` application we're sending a HTTP message to GitHub Analytic's endpoint. Then we're checking if
the received message count has increased.

The step is manual by default due to the fact that stage environment is often shared between
teams and some preparations on databases / infrastructure have to take place before running the tests.
Ideally these step should be fully automatic.

=== Prod

image::{intro-root-docs}/prod.png[title="Deployment to production"]

The step to deploy to production is manual but ideally it should be automatic.

IMPORTANT: This step does deployment to production. On production you would assume
that you have the infrastructure running. That's why before you run this step you
must execute a script that will provision the services on the production environment.
For `Cloud Foundry` just call `tools/cf-helper.sh setup-prod-infra` and
for Kubernetes `tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-prod-infra`

Here we're

- tagging the Git repo with `prod/${version}` tag
- downloading the application artifact (either JAR for Cloud Foundry or Docker image for Kubernetes)
- we're doing Blue Green deployment:
    - for Cloud Foundry
        * we're renaming the current instance of the app e.g. `fooService` to `fooService-venerable`
        * we're deploying the new instance of the app under the `fooService` name
        * now two instances of the same application are running on production
    - for Kubernetes
        * we're deploying a service with the name of the app e.g. `fooService`
        * we're doing a deployment with the name of the app with version suffix (with the name escaped
         to fulfill the DNS name requirements) e.g. `fooService-1-0-0-M1-123-456-VERSION`
        * all deployments of the same application have the same label `name` equal to app name e.g. `fooService`
        * the service is routing the traffic basing on the `name` label selector
        * now two instances of the same application are running on production
- in the `Complete switch over` which is a manual step
    * we're deleting the old instance
    * remember to run this step only after you have confirmed that both instances are working fine!
