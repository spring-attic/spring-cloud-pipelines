== Jenkins Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job Dsl plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github-Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins JOB Dsl based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-cf,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-cf,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-cf,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-cf]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-cf]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-cf]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-cf]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

[[deploy-infra-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-cf]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[start-pcf-dev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-cf-resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins-pcfdev-cf]] You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-cf]]
==== Run the seed job

include::JENKINS_RUN_SEED.adoc[]

[[jenkins-pipeline-cf]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

=== Jenkins Cloud Foundry customization

 All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.
