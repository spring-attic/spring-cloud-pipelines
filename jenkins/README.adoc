== Jenkins Pipeline (Common)

In this section we will present the common setup of Jenkins for any platform.
We will also provide answers to most frequently asked questions.

=== Project setup

[source,bash]

----

In the `declarative-pipeline` you can find a definition of a `Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy` declarative
pipeline. It's used together with the Blueocean UI.

In the `jobs` folder you have all the seed jobs that will generate pipelines.

- `jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Pipeline plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample.groovy` - is an opinionated implementation using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample_view.groovy` - builds the views for the pipelines

In the `seed` folder you have the `init.groovy` file which is executed when Jenkins starts.
That way we can configure most of Jenkins options for you (adding credentials, JDK etc.).
`jenkins_pipeline.groovy` contains logic to build a seed job (that way you don't have to even click that
job - we generate it for you). Under the `k8s` folder there are all the configuration
files required for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

In the `src` folder you have production and test classes needed for you to build your own pipeline.
Currently we have tests only cause the whole logic resides in the `jenkins_pipeline_sample` file.

=== Optional customization steps

[[jenkins_optional]] All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[deploying-infra]]
==== Deploying infra jars to a different location

It's enough to set the `ARTIFACTORY_URL` environmental variable before
executing `tools/deploy-infra.sh`. Example for deploying to Artifactory at IP `192.168.99.100`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" ./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

[[setup-settings-xml]]
==== Setup settings.xml for Maven deployment

TIP: If you want to use the default connection to the Docker version
of Artifactory you can skip this step

[[jenkins-settings]] So that `./mvnw deploy` works with Artifactory from Docker we're
already copying the missing `settings.xml` file for you. It looks more or less like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_ID}</id>
			<username>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${M2_SETTINGS_REPO_PASSWORD}</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>${DOCKER_SERVER_ID}</id>
			<username>${DOCKER_USERNAME}</username>
			<password>${DOCKER_PASSWORD}</password>
			<configuration>
				<email>${DOCKER_EMAIL}</email>
			</configuration>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
----

As you can see the file is parameterized. In Maven it's enough to pass
to `./mvnw` command the proper system property to override that value. For example to pass
a different docker email you'd have to call `./mvnw -DDOCKER_EMAIL=foo@bar.com` and the value
gets updated.

If you want to use your own version of Artifactory / Nexus you have to update
the file (it's in `seed/settings.xml`).

[[setup-jenkins-env-vars]]
==== Setup Jenkins env vars

[[jenkins_env]] If you want to only play around with the demo that we've prepared you have to set *ONE* variable which is the `REPOS` variable.
That variable needs to consists of comma separated list of URLs to repositories containing business apps. So you should pass your forked repos URLs.

You can do it in the following ways:

- globally via Jenkins global env vars (then when you run the seed that variable will be taken into consideration and proper pipelines will get built)
- modify the seed job parameters (you'll have to modify the seed job configuration and change the `REPOS` property)
- provide the repos parameter when running the seed job

For the sake of simplicity let's go with the *last* option.

IMPORTANT: If you're choosing the global envs, you *HAVE* to remove the other approach
(e.g. if you set the global env for `REPOS`, please remove that property in the
seed job

[[setup-seed-props]]
===== Seed properties

Click on the seed job and pick `Build with parameters`. Then as presented in the screen below (you'll have far more properties to set) just modify the `REPOS` property by providing the comma separated list of URLs to your forks. Whatever you set will be parsed by the seed job and passed to the generated Jenkins jobs.

TIP: This is very useful when the repos you want to build differ. E.g. use
different JDK. Then some seeds can set the `JDK_VERSION` param to one version
of Java installation and the others to another one.

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed.png[]

In the screenshot we could parametrize the `REPOS` and `REPO_WITH_BINARIES` params.

[[global-envs]]
===== Global envs

IMPORTANT: This section is presented only for informational purposes - for the sake of demo you can skip it

You can add env vars (go to configure Jenkins -> Global Properties) for the following
 properties (example with defaults for PCF Dev):

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/env_vars.png[]

[[git-email]]
==== Set Git email / user

Since our pipeline is setting the git user / name explicitly for the build step
 you'd have to go to `Configure` of the build step and modify the Git name / email.
 If you want to set it globally you'll have to remove the section from the build
 step and follow these steps to set it globally.

You can set Git email / user globally like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/git.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Fill out Git user information"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}


[[jenkins-credentials-github]]
===== Add Jenkins credentials for GitHub

[[jenkins-credentials]] The scripts will need to access the credential in order to tag the repo.

You have to set credentials with id: `git`.

Below you can find instructions on how to set a credential (e.g. for Cloud Foundry `cf-test` credential but
remember to provide the one with id `git`).

=== Testing Jenkins scripts

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

=== How to work with Jenkins Job DSL plugin

Check out the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL[tutorial].
Provide the link to this repository in your Jenkins installation.

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).

=== Docker Image

If you would like to run the pre-configured Jenkins image somewhere other than your local machine, we
have an image you can pull and use on https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins/[DockerHub].
The `latest` tag corresponds to the latest snapshot build.  You can also find tags
corresponding to stable releases that you can use as well.

IMPORTANT: The Jenkins docker image is setup for demo purposes. For example it has the following
system property `-Dpermissive-script-security.enabled=no_security` that disables script
security. *YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT ON PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING*.

// remove::start[CF]
[[jenkins-pipeline-cf]]
== Jenkins Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-cf,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-cf,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-cf,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-cf,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-cf]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-cf]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-cf]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-cf]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

Instead of the Git username and password parameters you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
if you prefer to use the key-based authentication with your Git repositories.

[[deploy-infra-cf]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-cf]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[start-pcf-dev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and don't want to use PCF Dev
The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-cf-resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins-pcfdev-cf]] You have to download and start PCF Dev. https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[A link how to do it is available here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----

You can start the PCF Dev like this:

[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----

You'll have to create 3 separate spaces (email admin, pass admin)

[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----

You can also execute the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-cf]]
==== Run the seed job

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.

[[jenkins-pipeline-cf]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics`.

{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/pipeline_run.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Run the pipeline"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on the *deploy previous version to stage* due to missing jar,
that means that you've forgotten to clear the tags in your repo. Typically that's due to the fact that
you've removed the Artifactory volume with deployed JAR whereas a tag in the repo is still pointing there.
<<tags,Check out this section on how to remove the tag.>>

IMPORTANT: Most likely you will run out of memory so when reaching the stage
environment it's good to kill all apps on test. <<faq,Check out the FAQ section for more details>>!

[[declarative-pipeline-cf]]
=== Declarative pipeline & Blue Ocean

You can also use the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[declarative pipeline] approach with the
https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean UI]. Here is a step by step guide to run a pipeline via
this approach.

The Blue Ocean UI is available under the `blue/` URL. E.g. for Docker Machine based setup `http://192.168.99.100:8080/blue`.

IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting pipeline from specific stage, after failure. Please
check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33846[issue] for more information

WARNING: Currently there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins is
blocking an executor when manual step is required. That means that you'll run out of executors
pretty fast. You can check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[issue] for
and this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42561241/how-to-wait-for-user-input-in-a-declarative-pipeline-without-blocking-a-heavywei[StackOverflow question]
for more information.

[[optional-steps-cf]]
=== Jenkins Cloud Foundry customization

 All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[all-env-vars-cf]]

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

[[jenkins-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-k8s]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-k8s]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg yourDockerRegistryOrganization yourDockerRegistryUsername yourDockerRegistryPassword yourDockerRegistryEmail
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter

contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

Instead of the Git username and password parameters you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
if you prefer to use the key-based authentication with your Git repositories.

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default we will
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline will be able
to push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built,
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images will be built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process will be reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That's why you don't have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster the driver
will not be shared by the Jenkins workers so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

[[jenkins-seed-k8s]]
==== Run the seed job

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.

[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics`.

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on the *deploy previous version to stage* due to missing jar,
that means that you've forgotten to clear the tags in your repo. Typically that's due to the fact that
you've removed the Artifactory volume with deployed JAR whereas a tag in the repo is still pointing there.
<<tags,Check out this section on how to remove the tag.>>

IMPORTANT: Most likely you will run out of memory so when reaching the stage
environment it's good to kill all apps on test. <<faq,Check out the FAQ section for more details>>!

[[declarative-pipeline-k8s]]
=== Declarative pipeline & Blue Ocean

You can also use the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[declarative pipeline] approach with the
https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean UI]. Here is a step by step guide to run a pipeline via
this approach.

The Blue Ocean UI is available under the `blue/` URL. E.g. for Docker Machine based setup `http://192.168.99.100:8080/blue`.

IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting pipeline from specific stage, after failure. Please
check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33846[issue] for more information

WARNING: Currently there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins is
blocking an executor when manual step is required. That means that you'll run out of executors
pretty fast. You can check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[issue] for
and this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42561241/how-to-wait-for-user-input-in-a-declarative-pipeline-without-blocking-a-heavywei[StackOverflow question]

=== Preparing to connect to GCE

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using GCE

In order to use GCE we need to have `gcloud` running. If you already have the
CLI installed, skip this step. If not just execute to have the CLI
downloaded and an installer started

```bash
$ ./tools/k8s-helper.sh download-gcloud
```

Next, configure `gcloud`. Execute `gcloud init` and log in
to your cluster. You will get redirected to a login page, pick the
proper Google account and log in.

Pick an existing project or create a new one.

Go to your platform page (click on `Container Engine`) in GCP and connect to your cluster

```bash
$ CLUSTER_NAME=...
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ PROJECT_NAME=...
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_NAME}
$ kubectl proxy
```

The Kubernetes dashboard will be running at `http://localhost:8001/ui/`.

We'll need a Persistent Disk for our Jenkins installation. Let's create it

```bash
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ gcloud compute disks create --size=200GB --zone=${ZONE} sc-pipelines-jenkins-disk
```

Since the disk got created now we need to format it. You can check out
the instructions on how to do it here - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting

=== Connecting to a Kubo or GCE cluster

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using Kubo or GCE

In this section a description of steps required to deploy Jenkins and
Artifactory to a Kubernetes cluster deployed via Kubo.

TIP: To see the dashboard just do `kubectl proxy` and access `localhost:8081/ui`

- Log in to the cluster
- Deploy Jenkins and Artifactory to the cluster
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-vsphere` for a cluster deployed on VSphere
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-gce` for a cluster deployed to GCE
- Forward the ports so that you can access the Jenkins UI from your local machine

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=default
$ JENKINS_POD=jenkins-1430785859-nfhx4
$ LOCAL_PORT=32044
$ CONTAINER_PORT=8080
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} ${JENKINS_POD} ${LOCAL_PORT}:${CONTAINER_PORT}
```
- Go to `Credentials`, click `System` and `Global credentials`

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/kubo_credentials.png[caption="Click `Global credentials`"]

- Update `git`, `repo-with-binaries` and `docker-registry` credentials
- Run the `jenkins-pipeline-k8s-seed` seed job and fill it out with the following data
* Put `kubernetes.default:443` here (or `KUBERNETES_API:KUBERNETES_PORT`)
** `PAAS_TEST_API_URL`
** `PAAS_STAGE_API_URL`
** `PAAS_PROD_API_URL`
* Put `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` data here
** `PAAS_TEST_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CA_PATH`
* Uncheck the `Kubernetes Minikube` value
* Clear the following vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
* Set `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` value to these vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
* Set the cluster name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`
* Set the system name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_SYSTEM_NAME`
* Update the `DOCKER_EMAIL` property with your email
* Update the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_ORGANIZATION` with your Docker organization name
* If you don't want to upload the images to DockerHub update  `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`
