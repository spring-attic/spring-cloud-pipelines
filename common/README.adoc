There is one script called `pipeline.sh` that contains all the functions
reused by other scripts.

Every other script represents the logic required to perform a step in the
pipeline.

Currently the flow looks like this:

*Build phase*

`build and upload -> `

*Test phase*

`test deploy -> test smoke -> test rollback smoke
