pipeline.sh(1)
==============
:compat-mode!:

NAME
----
pipeline.sh - a shell script

SYNOPSIS
--------

Contains interfaces for all essential functions for different
steps of deployment pipeline.

Sources:
- projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh
- pipeline-${paasType}.sh (e.g. pipeline-cf.sh)
- custom/${scriptName}.sh (e.g. custom/build_and_upload.sh)

Essentially, the scripts implementing the functions can be divided
into 2 types.

1) Build related
2) Deployment related

The build related scripts need to define how to build an application.
E.g. for Java we're using Maven or Gradle to build a project. For other
languages other frameworks and approaches would be applicable. You can
arbitrarily chose the language type via the LANGUAGE_TYPE env variable
or via the language_type pipeline descriptor entry. That value, via convention,
gets applied to the string [projectType/pipeline-${languageType}.sh] that
represents a file that we will source in order to apply all the build functions.
The deployment related scripts need to define how to upload the application.
For Java and Cloud Foundry we're using the CF CLI to push the binary
to PAAS. For NPM we're pushing sources. You can
arbitrarily chose the platform type via the PAAS_TYPE env variable That value,
via convention, gets applied to the string [pipeline-${paasType}.sh]
that represents a file that we will source in order to apply all the deployment functions.
