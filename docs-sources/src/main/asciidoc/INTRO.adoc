== Introduction

In the following section we will describe in more depth the rationale
behind the presented opinionated pipeline. We will go through each deployment
step and describe it in details.

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
.
├── common
├── concourse
├── docs
└── jenkins
----

In the `common` folder you can find all the Bash scripts containing the pipeline logic. These
scripts are reused by both Concourse and Jenkins pipelines.

In the `concourse` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Concourse demo.

In the `docs` section you have the whole documentation of the project.

In the `jenkins` folder you can find all the necessary scripts and setup to run Jenkins demo.

=== How to use it?

This repository can be treated as a template for your pipeline. We provide some opinionated
implementation that you can alter to suit your needs. The best approach to use it
to build your production projects would be to download the Spring Cloud Pipelines repository as ZIP, then
init a Git project there and modify it as you wish.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -LOk https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/archive/v1.0.0.M4.zip
$ unzip v1.0.0.M4.zip
$ cd spring-cloud-pipelines-v1.0.0.M4
$ git init
$ # modify the pipelines to suit your needs
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin ${YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL}
$ git push origin master
----

NOTE: Why aren't you simply cloning the repo? This is meant to be a seed
for building new, versioned pipelines for you. You don't want to have all of our
history dragged along with you, don't you?

=== The flow

Let's take a look at the flow of the opinionated pipeline

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow_concourse.png[title="Flow in Concourse"]

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow.png[title="Flow in Jenkins"]

We'll first describe the overall concept behind the flow and then
we'll split it into pieces and describe every piece independently.

=== Environments

So we're on the same page let's define some common vocabulary. We discern 4 typical
environments in terms of running the pipeline.

- build
- test
- stage
- prod

*Build* environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It's a CI / CD tool worker.

*Test* is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It doesn’t
resemble production, we can't be sure of it's state (which application is deployed there
and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.

*Stage* is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely applications
 are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
 Typically databases there are filled up with (obfuscated) production data. Most
 often this environment is a single, shared one between many teams. In other
 words in order to run some performance, user acceptance tests you have to block
 and wait until the environment is free.

*Prod* is a production environment where we want our tested applications to be deployed
for our customers.

=== Tests

*Unit tests* - tests that are executed on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases / HTTP server stubs etc. take place. Generally speaking your application should
 have plenty of these to have fast feedback if your features are working fine.

*Integration tests* - tests that are executed on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in memory databases / HTTP server stubs take place. According to the test
pyramid, in most cases you should have not too many of these kind of tests.

*Smoke tests* - tests that are executed on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain most money from e.g. 5 features then you could write smoke tests
 for those 5 features. As you can see we're talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
 the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
 executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.

*End to end tests* - tests that are executed on a system composing of multiple applications.
The idea of these tests is to check if the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, resources to maintain such an environment
and that often those tests are unreliable (due to many different moving pieces like network
database etc.) you should have a handful of those tests. Only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
don't even want to do those and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting you can quickly react when your deployed application
is not behaving properly.

*Performance testing* - tests executed on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle big load of input. In case of our opinionated pipeline
 these tests could be executed either on test (against stubbed environment) or
  stage (against the whole system)


==== Testing against stubs

Before we go into details of the flow let's take a look at the following example.

image::{intro-root-docs}/monolith.png[title="Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing"]

When having only a handful of applications, performing end to end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective it's maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective it's nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.

In case of microservices the scale starts to be a problem:

image::{intro-root-docs}/many_microservices.png[title="Many microservices deployed in different versions"]

The questions arise:

- Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?
  * If I queue deployments people will have to wait for hours to have their tests ran - that can be a problem
- To remove that issue I can have an environment per microservice
  * Who will pay the bills (imagine 100 microservices - each having each own environment).
  * Who will support each of those environments?
  * Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
  them up and running for the whole day?
- In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?
  * If I have development versions then I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
  That can lead to exceptions on production
  * If I test against production versions then I'll never be able to test against a feature under development
  anytime before deployment to production.

One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to... not do end to end tests.

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies"]

If we stub out all the dependencies of our application then most of the problems presented above
disappear. There is no need to start and setup infrastructure required by the dependant
microservices. That way the testing setup looks like this:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="We're testing microservices in isolation"]

Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract]):

- No need to deploy dependant services
- The stubs used for the tests ran on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests
- Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (check http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract] for more information)
- We don't have many slow tests running on a deployed application - thus the pipeline gets executed much faster
- We don't have to queue deployments - we're testing in isolation thus pipelines don't interfere with each other
- We don't have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes

It brings however the following challenges:

- No end to end tests before production - you don't have the full certainty that a feature is working
- First time the applications will talk in a real way will be on production

Like every solution it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
 allows you to configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.

==== General view

The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:

- test the application in isolation
- test the backwards compatibility of the application in order to roll it back if necessary
- allow testing of the packaged app in a deployed environment
- allow user acceptance tests / performance tests in a deployed environment
- allow deployment to production

Obviously the pipeline could have been split to more steps but it seems that all of the aforementioned
 actions comprise nicely in our opinionated proposal.

=== CI Server worker prerequisites

Spring Cloud Pipelines uses Bash scripts extensively. Below you can find the list of software
that needs to be installed on a CI server worker for the build to pass.

TIP: In the demo setup all of these libraries are already installed.

[source,bash]
----
 apt-get -y install \
    bash \
    git \
    tar \
    zip \
    curl \
    ruby \
    wget \
    unzip \
    python \
    jq
----

IMPORTANT: In the Jenkins case you will also need `bats` and `shellcheck`. They are not
presented in the list since the installed versions by Linux distributions might be old.
That's why this project's Gradle tasks will download latest versions of both libraries
for you.

=== Pipeline descriptor

Each application can contain a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
lowercaseEnvironmentName1:
    services:
        - type: service1Type
          name: service1Name
          coordinates: value
        - type: service2Type
          name: service2Name
          key: value
lowercaseEnvironmentName2:
    services:
        - type: service3Type
          name: service3Name
          coordinates: value
        - type: service4Type
          name: service4Name
          key: value
----

For a given environment we declare a list of infrastructure services that we
want to have deployed. Services have

    - `type` (example: `eureka`, `mysql`, `rabbitmq`, `stubrunner`) - this value gets
    then applied to the `deployService` Bash function
        - *[KUBERNETES]* for `mysql` you can pass the database name via the `database`
        property
    - `name` - name of the service to get deployed
    - `coordinates` - coordinate that allows you to fetch the binary of the service.
      Examples: It can be a maven coordinate `groupid:artifactid:version`,
       docker image `organization/nameOfImage`, etc.
    - arbitrary key value pairs - you can customize the services as you wish

The `stubrunner` type can also have the `useClasspath` flag turned on to `true`
or `false`.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
test:
  services:
    - type: rabbitmq
      name: rabbitmq-github-webhook
    - type: mysql
      name: mysql-github-webhook
    - type: eureka
      name: eureka-github-webhook
      coordinates: com.example.eureka:github-eureka:0.0.1.M1
    - type: stubrunner
      name: stubrunner-github-webhook
      coordinates: com.example.eureka:github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs:0.0.1.M1
      useClasspath: true
stage:
  services:
    - type: rabbitmq
      name: rabbitmq-github
    - type: mysql
      name: mysql-github
    - type: eureka
      name: github-eureka
      coordinates: com.example.eureka:github-eureka:0.0.1.M1
----

When the deployment to test or deployment to stage occurs, Spring Cloud Pipelines
will:

    - for `test` environment, delete existing services and redeploy the ones from the list
    - for `stage` environment, if the service is not available it will get deployed. Otherwise
    nothing will happen
