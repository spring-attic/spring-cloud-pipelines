== Introduction

In the following section we will describe in more depth the rationale
behind the presented opinionated pipeline. We will go through each deployment
step and describe it in details.

IMPORTANT: You don't need to use all pieces of Spring Cloud Pipelines. You
can (and should) gradually migrate your applications to use those pieces of
Spring Cloud Pipelines that you think best suit your needs.

=== 5 second introduction

Spring Cloud Pipelines provides scripts, configuration and convention for automated
deployment pipeline creation for Jenkins, Concourse with Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes.
We support JVM languages, PHP, NodeJS out of the box. Since SC-Pipelines uses bash scripts
you can use it with whatever automation server you have.

=== 5 minute introduction

Spring Cloud Pipelines comes with bash scripts (available under `common/src/main/bash`)
that represent the logic of all steps in our opinionated deployment pipeline.
Since we believe in convention over configuration, for the supported framework and
languages, we assume that the projects follow certain convention of task naming,
profile setting etc. That way if you create a new application, it's enough for
your app to follow those conventions and the deployment pipeline will work out of
the box. Since there's no way that one pipeline can serve the purposes of all
teams in a company we believe that minor deployment pipeline tweaking should take place,
that's why we allow the usage of `sc-pipelines.yml` descriptor, that allows to
provide some customization.

From the pipeline visualization perspective, we have prepared templates for Concourse
and Jenkins (via Jenkins Job DSL and Jenkinsfile). That means you can reuse them
immediately to visualize a deployment pipeline. If you use some other tool for
continuous delivery, you can set the visualization yourself and reference the
bash scripts for each step. In other words, Spring Cloud Pipelines can be reused
with any continuous delivery tool.

==== How to use it?

This repository can be treated as a template for your pipeline. We provide some opinionated
implementation that you can alter to suit your needs. The best approach to use it
to build your production projects would be to download the Spring Cloud Pipelines repository as ZIP, then
init a Git project there and modify it as you wish.

[source,bash]
----
$ # pass the branch (e.g. master) or a particular tag (e.g. v1.0.0.RELEASE)
$ SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE=...
$ curl -LOk https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines/archive/${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ unzip ${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}.zip
$ cd spring-cloud-pipelines-${SC_PIPELINES_RELEASE}
$ git init
$ # modify the pipelines to suit your needs
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin ${YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL}
$ git push origin master
----

You can also clone the repository in case you would like to keep aligned
with the changes in the upstream repository. In order not to have many merge
conflicts it's encouraged to use the `custom` folder hooks to override functions.

==== How does it work?

image::{intro-root-docs}/how.png[title="How Spring Cloud Pipelines works"]

Spring Cloud Pipelines contains logic both to generate a pipeline and the runtime
to execute pipeline steps as presented in the picture.

Once a pipeline is created (e.g. via Jenkins Job DSL or from Concourse templated
pipeline), when the jobs are ran, they clone / download Spring Cloud Pipelines
code in order to run each step. Those steps are executing functions, that are
defined in the `commons` module of Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Spring Cloud Pipelines performs steps to guess what kind of a project your
repository is (e.g. JVM, PHP), what framework it uses (Maven, Gradle), and it
can deploy your application to a cloud (CF, K8S). You can read about how
it works by reading <<how-do-the-scripts-work>> section.

All of that happens out of the box if your application follows conventions.
You can read about them in <<project-opinions>> section.

==== Supported languages

Currently we support out of the box:

* JVM
** Maven wrapper based project
** Gradle wrapper based project
* PHP
** Composer based project
* NPM

==== Centralized pipeline creation

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines to generate pipelines
for all projects in your system. You can scan all your
repositories (e.g. call the Stash / Github API and retrieve the list of repos)
and then...

* For Jenkins, call the seed job and pass the `REPOS`
parameter that would contain the list of repositories
* For Concourse, you'd have to call `fly` and set
pipeline for every single repo

TIP: This is the suggested way of using Spring Cloud Pipelines

==== Pipeline per repository

You can use Spring Cloud Pipelines in such a way that
each project contains its own pipeline definition in
its code. Spring Cloud Pipelines clones the code with
the pipeline definitions (the bash scripts) so the
only piece of logic that could be there in your application's
repository would be how the pipeline should look like.

* For Jenkins, you'd have to either set up the `Jenkinsfile`
or the jobs using Jenkins Job DSL plugin in your repo.
Then in Jenkins whenever you set up a new pipeline for a repo
then you reference the pipeline definition in that repo.
* For Concourse, each project contains its own pipeline steps
and it's up to the project to set up the pipeline.

=== The flow

Let's take a look at the flow of the opinionated pipeline

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow_concourse.png[title="Flow in Concourse"]

image::{intro-root-docs}/flow.png[title="Flow in Jenkins"]

We'll first describe the overall concept behind the flow and then
we'll split it into pieces and describe every piece independently.

=== Environments

So we're on the same page let's define some common vocabulary. We discern 4 typical
environments in terms of running the pipeline.

- *build* environment is a machine where the building of the application takes place.
It's a CI / CD tool worker.
- *test* is an environment where you can deploy an application to test it. It doesn’t
resemble production, we can't be sure of it's state (which application is deployed there
and in which version). It can be used by multiple teams at the same time.
- *stage* is an environment that does resemble production. Most likely applications
are deployed there in versions that correspond to those deployed to production.
Typically databases there are filled up with (obfuscated) production data. Most
often this environment is a single, shared one between many teams. In other
words in order to run some performance, user acceptance tests you have to block
and wait until the environment is free.
- *prod* is a production environment where we want our tested applications to be deployed
for our customers.

=== Tests

*Unit tests* - tests that are executed on the application during the build phase.
No integrations with databases / HTTP server stubs etc. take place. Generally speaking your application should
 have plenty of these to have fast feedback if your features are working fine.

*Integration tests* - tests that are executed on the built application during the build phase.
Integrations with in memory databases / HTTP server stubs take place. According to the test
pyramid, in most cases you should have not too many of these kind of tests.

*Smoke tests* - tests that are executed on a deployed application. The concept of these tests
is to check the crucial parts of your application are working properly. If you have 100 features
in your application but you gain most money from e.g. 5 features then you could write smoke tests
 for those 5 features. As you can see we're talking about smoke tests of an application, not of
 the whole system. In our understanding inside the opinionated pipeline, these tests are
 executed against an application that is surrounded with stubs.

*End to end tests* - tests that are executed on a system composing of multiple applications.
The idea of these tests is to check if the tested feature works when the whole system is set up.
Due to the fact that it takes a lot of time, effort, resources to maintain such an environment
and that often those tests are unreliable (due to many different moving pieces like network
database etc.) you should have a handful of those tests. Only for critical parts of your business.
Since only production is the key verifier of whether your feature works, some companies
don't even want to do those and move directly to deployment to production. When your
system contains KPI monitoring and alerting you can quickly react when your deployed application
is not behaving properly.

*Performance testing* - tests executed on an application or set of applications
to check if your system can handle big load of input. In case of our opinionated pipeline
 these tests could be executed either on test (against stubbed environment) or
  stage (against the whole system)

==== Testing against stubs

Before we go into details of the flow let's take a look at the following example.

image::{intro-root-docs}/monolith.png[title="Two monolithic applications deployed for end to end testing"]

When having only a handful of applications, performing end to end testing is beneficial.
From the operations perspective it's maintainable for a finite number of deployed instances.
From the developers perspective it's nice to verify the whole flow in the system
for a feature.

In case of microservices the scale starts to be a problem:

image::{intro-root-docs}/many_microservices.png[title="Many microservices deployed in different versions"]

The questions arise:

- Should I queue deployments of microservices on one testing environment or should I have an environment per microservice?
  * If I queue deployments people will have to wait for hours to have their tests ran - that can be a problem
- To remove that issue I can have an environment per microservice
  * Who will pay the bills (imagine 100 microservices - each having each own environment).
  * Who will support each of those environments?
  * Should we spawn a new environment each time we execute a new pipeline and then wrap it up or should we have
  them up and running for the whole day?
- In which versions should I deploy the dependent microservices - development or production versions?
  * If I have development versions then I can test my application against a feature that is not yet on production.
  That can lead to exceptions on production
  * If I test against production versions then I'll never be able to test against a feature under development
  anytime before deployment to production.

One of the possibilities of tackling these problems is to... not do end to end tests.

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="Execute tests on a deployed microservice on stubbed dependencies"]

If we stub out all the dependencies of our application then most of the problems presented above
disappear. There is no need to start and setup infrastructure required by the dependant
microservices. That way the testing setup looks like this:

image::{intro-root-docs}/stubbed_dependencies.png[title="We're testing microservices in isolation"]

Such an approach to testing and deployment gives the following benefits
(thanks to the usage of http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract]):

- No need to deploy dependant services
- The stubs used for the tests ran on a deployed microservice are the same as those used during integration tests
- Those stubs have been tested against the application that produces them (check http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html[Spring Cloud Contract] for more information)
- We don't have many slow tests running on a deployed application - thus the pipeline gets executed much faster
- We don't have to queue deployments - we're testing in isolation thus pipelines don't interfere with each other
- We don't have to spawn virtual machines each time for deployment purposes

It brings however the following challenges:

- No end to end tests before production - you don't have the full certainty that a feature is working
- First time the applications will talk in a real way will be on production

Like every solution it has its benefits and drawbacks. The opinionated pipeline
 allows you to configure whether you want to follow this flow or not.

==== General view

The general view behind this deployment pipeline is to:

- test the application in isolation
- test the backwards compatibility of the application in order to roll it back if necessary
- allow testing of the packaged app in a deployed environment
- allow user acceptance tests / performance tests in a deployed environment
- allow deployment to production

Obviously the pipeline could have been split to more steps but it seems that all of the aforementioned
 actions comprise nicely in our opinionated proposal.

=== Pipeline descriptor

Each application can contain a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
language_type: jvm
pipeline:
	# used for multi module projects
	main_module: foo/bar
	# used for multi projects
	project_names:
		- monoRepoA
		- monoRepoB
	# should deploy to stage automatically and run e2e tests
	auto_stage: true
	# should deploy to production automatically
	auto_prod: true
	# should the api compatibility check be there
	api_compatibility_step: true
	# should the test rollback step be there
	rollback_step: true
	# should the stage step be there
	stage_step: true
	# should the test step (including rollback) be there
	test_step: true
lowercaseEnvironmentName1:
	# used by spinnaker
	deployment_strategy: HIGHlANDER
	# list of services to be deployed
	services:
		- type: service1Type
		  name: service1Name
		  coordinates: value
		- type: service2Type
		  name: service2Name
		  key: value
lowercaseEnvironmentName2:
	# used by spinnaker
	deployment_strategy: HIGHlANDER
	# list of services to be deployed
	services:
		- type: service3Type
		  name: service3Name
		  coordinates: value
		- type: service4Type
		  name: service4Name
		  key: value
----

If you have a multi-module project, you should point to the folder, where your
module that produces the fat jar lays. In the aforementioned example that module
would be present under the `foo/bar` folder. If you have a single module project,
then you don't have to create this section.

For a given environment we declare a list of infrastructure services that we
want to have deployed. Services have

    - `type` (example: `eureka`, `mysql`, `rabbitmq`, `stubrunner`) - this value gets
    then applied to the `deployService` Bash function
        - *[KUBERNETES]* for `mysql` you can pass the database name via the `database`
        property
    - `name` - name of the service to get deployed
    - `coordinates` - coordinate that allows you to fetch the binary of the service.
      Examples: It can be a maven coordinate `groupid:artifactid:version`,
       docker image `organization/nameOfImage`, etc.
    - arbitrary key value pairs - you can customize the services as you wish

==== Pipeline descriptor for Cloud Foundry

When deploying to Cloud Foundry you can provide services
of the following types:

- `type: broker`
* `broker` - name of the CF broker
* `plan` - name of the plan
* `params` - additional parameters that will be converted to JSON
* `useExisting` - should use existing one or
create a new one (defaults to `false`)
- `type: app`
* `coordinates` - maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
* `manifestPath` - path to the manifest for the stub runner jar
- `type: cups`
* `params` - additional parameters that will be converted to JSON
- `type: cupsSyslog`
* `url` - URL to the syslog drain
- `type: cupsRoute`
* `url` - URL to the route service
- `type: stubrunner`
* `coordinates` - maven coordinates of the stub runner jar
* `manifestPath` - path to the manifest for the stub runner jar

[source,yaml]

# in order for the smoke tests on the TEST environment and end to end tests
# on the STAGE environment to pass

      plan: standard
----

Another CF specific property is `artifact_type`. It can be either `binary` or `source`.
Certain languages require a binary to get uploaded (e.g. JAVA) but with others
you have to push the sources (e.g. PHP). The default value is `binary`.

=== Project Setup

Spring Cloud Pipelines supports three main types of project setup
- `Single Project`
- `Multi Module`
- `Multi Project` (aka mono repo)

A `Single Project` is a project that contains a single module that gets
built and package into a single, executable artifact.

A `Multi Module` project is a project that contains a multiple modules.
After building all modules, one gets packaged into a single, executable artifact.
You have to point to that module in your pipeline descriptor.

A `Multi Project` is a project that contains multiple projects. Each of those
projects can be in turn a `Single Project` or a `Multi Module` project. Spring
Cloud Pipelines will assume that if there's a `PROJECT_NAME` environment
variable that corresponds to a folder with the same name in the root of the
repository, that means that this is the project it should build. E.g for
`PROJECT_NAME=foo`, if there's a folder `foo`, then Spring Cloud Pipelines
will treat the `foo` directory as the root of the `foo` project.

```

Before we run the script we need to answer the questions related to your repo

* what is your language (e.g. `jvm`,`php`)?
* what framework do you use (e.g. `maven`, `gradle`)?
* what PAAS do you use (e.g. `cf`, `k8s`)?

* A script e.g. `build_and_upload.sh` is called
* It sources the `pipeline.sh` that contains all the essential function "interfaces" and
environment variables
* `pipeline.sh` needs information about the project type - it
will source `projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh`
* `projectType/pipeline-projectType.sh` contains logic to decide on what the language is
** verify if a repo contains files corresponding to given languages (e.g. `mvnw`, `composer.json`)
** verify if there's a concrete framework that we support (e.g. `maven` or `gradle`)
* once we know what the project type is we can deal with PAAS. Depending on the environment
variable `PAAS_TYPE` we can source proper PAAS functions. E.g. `pipeline-cf.sh` for Cloud Foundry.
* we've got the functions loaded, now we can see if we can do some further customization
** we will search for a file called `${sc-pipelines-root}/common/src/main/bash/custom/build_and_upload.sh`
to override any functions you want
* now we can run the `build` function from `build_and_upload.sh`

[[project-crawler]]
=== Project Crawler

In Jenkins, you can generate the deployment pipelines by passing an environment variable with a comma
separated list of repositories. This however doesn't scale. We would like to automatically fetch
a list of all repositories from a given organization / team.

That's why we're using the https://github.com/spring-cloud/project-crawler[Project Crawler]
library, that is able to:

* fetch all projects for a given organization
* fetch contents of a file for a given repository

Thanks to the Project Crawler you can run the seed job and automatically all the new repositories
will be picked and pipelines will be created for them. Project Crawler supports repositories
stored at Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket. You can also register your own implementation. Please check the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/project-crawler[Project Crawler] repository for more information.

=== How do the scripts work with Spinnaker?

With Spinnaker, the deployment pipeline lays inside of Spinnaker. No longer do we treat
Jenkins or Concourse as a tool that does deployments too. In Jenkins we will only create
the CI jobs (i.e. build, test) and prepare the JSON definitions of Spinnaker pipelines.

The diagram below shows how Jenkins, the seed job for Spinnaker and Spinnaker as such cooperate.
