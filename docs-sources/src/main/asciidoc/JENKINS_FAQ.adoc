== Jenkins FAQ

Below you can find the answers to most frequently asked questions.

=== Pipeline version contains ${PIPELINE_VERSION}

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----

To fix it you have to do exactly what the warning suggests... Also ensure that the `Groovy token macro processing`
checkbox is set.

=== Pipeline version is not passed to the build

You can see that the Jenkins version is properly set but in the build version is still snapshot and
the `echo "${PIPELINE_VERSION}"` doesn't print anything.

You can check the Jenkins logs and you'll see

[source,bash]
----

=== The build times out with `pipeline.sh` info

Docker compose, docker compose, docker compose... The problem is that for some reason, only in Docker, the execution of
Java hangs. But it hangs randomly and only the first time you try to execute the pipeline.

The solution to this is to run the pipeline again. If once it suddenly, magically passes then
it will pass for any subsequent build.

Another thing that you can try is to run it with plain Docker. Maybe that will help.

=== Can I use the pipeline for some other repos?

Sure! you can pass `REPOS` variable with comma separated list of
`project_name$project_url` format. If you don't provide the PROJECT_NAME the
repo name will be extracted and used as the name of the project.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `github-analytics` and `github-webhook`.

E.g. for `REPOS` equal to:

`foo$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,bar$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/atom-feed`

will result in the creation of pipelines with root names `foo` for `github-analytics`
and `bar` for `github-webhook`.

=== Will this work for ANY project out of the box?

Not really. This is an `opinionated pipeline` that's why we took some
opinionated decisions like:

- usage of Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner and Spring Cloud Eureka
- application deployment to Cloud Foundry
- For Maven:
    * usage of Maven Wrapper
    * artifacts deployment by `./mvnw clean deploy`
    * `stubrunner.ids` property to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded
    * running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` Maven profile
    * running end to end tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` Maven profile
- For Gradle (in the `github-analytics` application check the `gradle/pipeline.gradle` file):
    * usage of Gradlew Wrapper
    * `deploy` task for artifacts deployment
    * running smoke tests on a deployed app via the `smoke` task
    * running end to end tests on a deployed app via the `e2e` task
    * `groupId` task to retrieve group id
    * `artifactId` task to retrieve artifact id
    * `currentVersion` task to retrieve the current version
    * `stubIds` task to retrieve list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded

This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

=== Can I modify this to reuse in my project?

Sure! It's open-source! The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written
in Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash
scripts without changing the whole pipeline.

=== The rollback step fails due to missing JAR ?!

[[jenkins_tags]] You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, just remove the tags

[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin

=== I want to provide a different JDK version

- by default we assume that you have jdk with id `jdk8` configured
- if you want a different one just override `JDK_VERSION` env var and point to the proper one

TIP: The docker image comes in with Java installed at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
You can go to `Global Tools` and create a JDK with `jdk8` id and JAVA_HOME
 pointing to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`

To change the default one just follow these steps:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/global_tool.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Global Tool'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk_installation.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click 'JDK Installations'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk.png[caption="Step 4: ", title="Fill out JDK Installation with path to your JDK"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

And that's it!

[[groovy-token-macro]]
=== Enable Groovy Token Macro Processing

With scripted that but if you needed to this manually then this is how to do it:

{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/configure_system.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Configure System'"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/groovy_token.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click 'Allow token macro processing'"]

=== I want deployment to stage and prod be automatic

No problem, just set the property / env var to true

- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_STAGE` to automatically deploy to stage
- `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` to automatically deploy to prod

=== I don't want to test API compativility

No problem, just set the `API_COMPATIBILITY_STEP_REQUIRED` env variable
to `false` and rerun the seed (you can pick it from the seed
job's properties too).

=== I can't tag the repo!

When you get sth like this:

[source,bash]
----
19:01:44 stderr: remote: Invalid username or password.
19:01:44 fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/github-webhook/'

most likely you've passed a wrong password. Check the <<jenkins_credentials,credentials>> section
on how to update your credentials.

=== I'm unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars

Most likely you've forgotten to update your local `settings.xml` with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<jenkins_settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml`>>.

=== Signing Artifacts

In some cases it may be required that when performing a release that the artifacts be signed
before pushing them to the repository.
To do this you will need to import your GPG keys into the Docker image running Jenkins.
This can be done by placing a file called `public.key` containing your public key
and a file called `private.key` containing your private key in the `seed` directory.
These keys will be imported by the `init.groovy` script that is run when Jenkins starts.

=== Using SSH keys for git

The seed job checks if an env variable `GIT_USE_SSH_KEY` is set to `true`. If that's the case
then env variable `GIT_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID` will be chosen as the one that contains the
id of the credential that contains SSH private key. By default `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID` will be picked
as the one that contains username and password to connect to git.

You can set these values in the seed job by filling out the form / toggling a checkbox.

=== Deploy to stage fails and doesn't redeploy a service (Kubernetes)

There can be a number of reason but remember that for stage we
assume that a sequence of manual steps need to be performed. We don't
redeploy any existing services cause most likely you deliberately
have set it up in that way or the other. If in the logs of your application
you can see that you can't connect to a service, first ensure that
the service is forwarding traffic to a pod. Next if that's not the case
please delete the service and re-run the step in the pipeline. That way
Spring Cloud Pipelines will redeploy the service and the underlying pods.
