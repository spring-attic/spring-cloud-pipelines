== Jenkins Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job Dsl plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github-Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins JOB Dsl based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-k8s,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-k8s,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-minikube-k8s,Start Minikube (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-k8s,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-k8s]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-k8s]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg yourDockerRegistryOrganization yourDockerRegistryUsername yourDockerRegistryPassword yourDockerRegistryEmail
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default we will
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline will be able
to push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built,
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images will be built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process will be reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That's why you don't have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster the driver
will not be shared by the Jenkins workers so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

==== Kubernetes CLI Installation

First you'll need to install the `kubectl` CLI.

[[kubernetes-cli-script]]
===== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/minikube-helper.sh` script to install `kubectl`. Just call

```bash
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-kubectl
```

and then the `kubectl` will get downloaded

[[kubernetes-cli-manual]]
==== Manual Installation

Example for OSX

```bash
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Example for Linux

```bash
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
$ chmod +x ./kubectl
$ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Check out https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[this page] for more information.

[[start-minikube-k8s]]
==== Kubernetes Cluster setup

We need a cluster of Kubernetes. The best choice will be https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube].

TIP: You can skip this step if you have Kubernetes cluster installed and don't
want to use Minikube The only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: It's more than likely that you'll run out of resources when you reach stage step.
Don't worry! Keep calm and <<jenkins-resources-k8s,clear some apps from Minikube and continue>>.

[[kubernetes-minikube-script]]
===== Script Installation

You can use the `tools/minikube-helper.sh` script to install `Minikube`. Just call

```bash
$ ./tools/minikube-helper download-minikube
```

and then the `Minikube` cluster will get downloaded

[[kubernetes-minikube-manual]]
===== Manual Installation

Example for OSX

```bash
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Feel free to leave off the `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you would like to add minikube to your path manually.

Example for Linux

```bash
$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.20.0/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Feel free to leave off the `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin` if you would like to add minikube to your path manually.
Check out https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases[this page] for more info on the installation.

==== Run Minikube

Just type in `minikube start` to start Kubernetes on your local box.

To add the dashboard just execute `minikube dashboard`

==== Certificates and Workers

===== Minikube Certificates and Workers

By default if you install Minikube all the certificates get installed in your
`~/.minikube` folder. Your `kubectl` configuration under `~/.kube/config` will also
get updated to use Minikube.

===== Manual Certificates and Workers Setup

IMPORTANT: If you just want to run the default, demo setup you can skip this section

To target a given Kubernetes instance one needs to pass around Certificate Authority
key and also user keys.

You can read more about the instructions on how to generate those keys https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/openssl.html[here].
 Generally speaking if you have a Kubernetes installation (e.g. `minikube`) this step
 has already been done for you. Time to reuse those keys on the workers.

Extracted from the https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/configure-kubectl.html[official docs].

Configure kubectl to connect to the target cluster using the following commands, replacing several values as indicated:

- Replace `${MASTER_HOST}` with the master node address or name used in previous steps
- Replace `${CA_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `ca.pem` created in previous steps
- Replace `${ADMIN_KEY}` with the absolute path to the `admin-key.pem` created in previous steps
- Replace `${ADMIN_CERT}` with the absolute path to the `admin.pem` created in previous steps

```
$ kubectl config set-cluster default-cluster --server=https://${MASTER_HOST} --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-credentials default-admin --certificate-authority=${CA_CERT} --client-key=${ADMIN_KEY} --client-certificate=${ADMIN_CERT}
$ kubectl config set-context default-system --cluster=default-cluster --user=default-admin
$ kubectl config use-context default-system
```

==== Generate Minikube namespaces

With the running Minikube cluster we need to generate namespaces. Just execute the
`./tools/minikube-helper.sh setup-namespaces` to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-k8s]]
==== Run the seed job

include::JENKINS_RUN_SEED.adoc[]

[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

include::JENKINS_RUN_PIPELINE.adoc[]

[[declarative-pipeline-k8s]]
=== Declarative pipeline & Blue Ocean

include::JENKINS_BLUE_OCEAN.adoc[]

[[optional-steps-k8s]]
=== Jenkins Kubernetes customization

 All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[all-env-vars-k8s]]
===== All env vars

The env vars that are used in all of the jobs are as follows:
