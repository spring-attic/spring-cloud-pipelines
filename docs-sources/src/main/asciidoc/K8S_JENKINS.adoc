[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
== Jenkins Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<jenkins-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
- <<jenkins-start-k8s,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-deploy-k8s,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
- <<jenkins-minikube-k8s,Start Minikube (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
- <<jenkins-seed-k8s,Run the seed job>>
- <<jenkins-pipeline-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork repos

[[jenkins-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-k8s]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-k8s]] Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do that just execute the
`start.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg yourDockerRegistryOrganization yourDockerRegistryUsername yourDockerRegistryPassword yourDockerRegistryEmail
----
Then Jenkins will be running on port `8080` and Artifactory `8081`.
The provided parameters will be passed as env variables to Jenkins VM
and credentials will be set in your set. That way you don't have to do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be yourForkedGithubOrg or yourGithubUsername. Also the `REPOS` env variable will
contain your GitHub org in which you have the forked repos.

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default we will
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline will be able
to push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]] When Artifactory is running, just execute the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----

As a result both `eureka` and `stub runner` repos will be cloned, built,
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images will be built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process will be reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That's why you don't have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster the driver
will not be shared by the Jenkins workers so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

[[jenkins-seed-k8s]]
==== Run the seed job

[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

=== Jenkins Kubernetes customization

IMPORTANT: All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[all-env-vars-k8s]]

=== Preparing to connect to GCE

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using GCE

In order to use GCE we need to have `gcloud` running. If you already have the
CLI installed, skip this step. If not just execute to have the CLI
downloaded and an installer started

```bash
$ ./tools/k8s-helper.sh download-gcloud
```

Next, configure `gcloud`. Execute `gcloud init` and log in
to your cluster. You will get redirected to a login page, pick the
proper Google account and log in.

Pick an existing project or create a new one.

Go to your platform page (click on `Container Engine`) in GCP and connect to your cluster

```bash
$ CLUSTER_NAME=...
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ PROJECT_NAME=...
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_NAME}
$ kubectl proxy
```

The Kubernetes dashboard will be running at `http://localhost:8001/ui/`.

We'll need a Persistent Disk for our Jenkins installation. Let's create it

```bash
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ gcloud compute disks create --size=200GB --zone=${ZONE} sc-pipelines-jenkins-disk
```

Since the disk got created now we need to format it. You can check out
the instructions on how to do it here - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting

=== Connecting to a Kubo or GCE cluster

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you're not using Kubo or GCE

In this section a description of steps required to deploy Jenkins and
Artifactory to a Kubernetes cluster deployed via Kubo.

TIP: To see the dashboard just do `kubectl proxy` and access `localhost:8081/ui`

- Log in to the cluster
- Deploy Jenkins and Artifactory to the cluster 
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-vsphere` for a cluster deployed on VSphere
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-gce` for a cluster deployed to GCE
- Forward the ports so that you can access the Jenkins UI from your local machine

```bash
$ NAMESPACE=default
$ JENKINS_POD=jenkins-1430785859-nfhx4
$ LOCAL_PORT=32044
$ CONTAINER_PORT=8080
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} ${JENKINS_POD} ${LOCAL_PORT}:${CONTAINER_PORT}
```
- Go to `Credentials`, click `System` and `Global credentials`

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/kubo_credentials.png[caption="Click `Global credentials`"]

- Update `git`, `repo-with-binaries` and `docker-registry` credentials
- Run the `jenkins-pipeline-k8s-seed` seed job and fill it out with the following data
* Put `kubernetes.default:443` here (or `KUBERNETES_API:KUBERNETES_PORT`)
** `PAAS_TEST_API_URL`
** `PAAS_STAGE_API_URL`
** `PAAS_PROD_API_URL`
* Put `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` data here
** `PAAS_TEST_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CA_PATH`
* Uncheck the `Kubernetes Minikube` value
* Clear the following vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
* Set `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` value to these vars
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
* Set the cluster name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`
* Set the system name to these vars (you can get it by calling `kubectl config current-context`)
** `PAAS_TEST_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_SYSTEM_NAME`
* Update the `DOCKER_EMAIL` property with your email
* Update the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_ORGANIZATION` with your Docker organization name
* If you don't want to upload the images to DockerHub update  `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`
