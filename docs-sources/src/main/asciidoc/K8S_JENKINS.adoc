[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
== Jenkins Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter, we assume that you deploy your application
to Kubernetes PaaS.

[[jenkins]]
The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline that uses https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and an opinionated sample pipeline that you can use in your company.

The following projects take part in the `microservice setup` for this demo.

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics]: The app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]: Project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka]: Simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics ad uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step-by-step

This is a guide for a Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible by using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<jenkins-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
. <<jenkins-start-k8s,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-deploy-k8s,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-minikube-k8s,Start Minikube (if you don't want to use an existing one)>>
. <<jenkins-seed-k8s,Run the seed job>>
. <<jenkins-pipeline-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork Repositories

[[jenkins-fork-k8s]]
Four applications compose the pipeline

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following repositories, because only then can you tag and push the tag to your repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-k8s]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-k8s]]
Jenkins and Artifactory can be ran locally. To do so, run the
`start.sh` script from this repo. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg yourDockerRegistryOrganization yourDockerRegistryUsername yourDockerRegistryPassword yourDockerRegistryEmail
----
====

Then Jenkins runs on port `8080`, and Artifactory runs on port `8081`.
The provided parameters are passed as environment variables to the Jenkins VM
and credentials are set. That way, you need not do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the preceding script, the third parameter
could be `yourForkedGithubOrg` or `yourGithubUsername`. Also the `REPOS` environment variable
contains your GitHub org in which you have the forked repositories.

Instead of the Git username and password parameters, you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
if you prefer to use the key-based authentication with your Git repositories.

You need to pass the credentials for the Docker organization (by default, we
search for the Docker images at Docker Hub) so that the pipeline can
push images to your org.

[[deploy-infra-k8s]]
===== Deploy the Infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-k8s]]
When Artifactory is running, run the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo.
The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra-k8s.sh
----
====

As a result, both the `eureka` and `stub runner` repos are cloned, built, and
uploaded to Artifactory and their docker images are built.

IMPORTANT: Your local Docker process is reused by the Jenkins instance running
in Docker. That is why you do not have to push these images to Docker Hub. On the
other hand, if you run this sample in a remote Kubernetes cluster, the driver
is not shared by the Jenkins workers, so you can consider pushing these
Docker images to Docker Hub too.

[[jenkins-seed-k8s]]
==== Run the seed job

[[jenkins-pipeline-k8s]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` pipeline

[[optional-steps-k8s]]
=== Jenkins Kubernetes customization

You can customize Jenkins for Cloud Foundry by setting a variety of environment variables.

NOTE: You need not see all the environment variables described in this section to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to make custom changes.

[[all-env-vars-k8s]]
==== All env vars

The environment variables that are used in all of the jobs are as follows:

|======================

=== Preparing to Connect to GCE

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you do not use GCE

In order to use GCE, we need to have `gcloud` running. If you already have the
CLI installed, skip this step. If not run the following command to have the CLI
downloaded and an installer started:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./tools/k8s-helper.sh download-gcloud
----
====

Next, configure `gcloud`. Run `gcloud init` and log in
to your cluster. You are redirected to a login page. Pick the
proper Google account and log in.

Pick an existing project or create a new one.

Go to your platform page (click on `Container Engine`) in GCP and connect to your cluster with the following values:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ CLUSTER_NAME=...
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ PROJECT_NAME=...
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_NAME}
$ kubectl proxy
----
====

The Kubernetes dashboard runs at `http://localhost:8001/ui/`.

We need a Persistent Disk for our Jenkins installation. Create it as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ZONE=us-east1-b
$ gcloud compute disks create --size=200GB --zone=${ZONE} sc-pipelines-jenkins-disk
----
====

Once the disk has been created, you need to format it. See
the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting

=== Connecting to a Kubo or GCE Cluster

IMPORTANT: Skip this step if you do not use Kubo or GCE

This section describes how to deploy Jenkins and
Artifactory to a Kubernetes cluster deployed with Kubo.

TIP: To see the dashboard, run `kubectl proxy` and access `localhost:8081/ui`.

. Log in to the cluster.
. Deploy Jenkins and Artifactory to the cluster:
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-vsphere` for a cluster deployed on VSphere
* `./tools/k8s-helper.sh setup-tools-infra-gce` for a cluster deployed to GCE
. Forward the ports so that you can access the Jenkins UI from your local machine, by using the following settings
====
[source,bash]
$ NAMESPACE=default
$ JENKINS_POD=jenkins-1430785859-nfhx4
$ LOCAL_PORT=32044
$ CONTAINER_PORT=8080
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} ${JENKINS_POD} ${LOCAL_PORT}:${CONTAINER_PORT}
----
====
. Go to `Credentials`, click `System` and `Global credentials`, as the following image shows:
image::{jenkins-root-docs}/kubo_credentials.png[caption="Click `Global credentials`"]
. Update `git`, `repo-with-binaries` and `docker-registry` credentials
. Run the `jenkins-pipeline-k8s-seed` seed job and fill it out with the following data
. Put `kubernetes.default:443` here (or `KUBERNETES_API:KUBERNETES_PORT`)
** `PAAS_TEST_API_URL`
** `PAAS_STAGE_API_URL`
** `PAAS_PROD_API_URL`
. Put `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` data here:
** `PAAS_TEST_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CA_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CA_PATH`
. Uncheck the `Kubernetes Minikube` value.
- Clear the following variables:
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`
. Set `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` value to these variables:
** `PAAS_TEST_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLIENT_TOKEN_PATH`
* Set the cluster name to these variables (you can get the cluster name by calling `kubectl config current-context`):
** `PAAS_TEST_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_CLUSTER_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`
. Set the system name to these variables (you can get the system name by calling `kubectl config current-context`):
** `PAAS_TEST_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_STAGE_SYSTEM_NAME`
** `PAAS_PROD_SYSTEM_NAME`
. Update the `DOCKER_EMAIL` property with your email address.
. Update the `DOCKER_REGISTRY_ORGANIZATION` with your Docker organization name.
. If you do not want to upload the images to DockerHub, update `DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL`.
image::{jenkins-root-docs}/pks_seed.png[caption="Example of a filled out seed job"]
. Run the pipeline
