=== Deploying production applications to Minikube

In the real world scenario we wouldn't want to automatically provision services like
RabbitMQ, MySQL or Eureka each time we deploy a new application to production. Typically
production is provisioned manually (using automated solutions). In our case, before
you deploy to production you can provision the `sc-pipelines-prod` namespace using the
 `minikube-helper.sh`. Just call

[source,bash]
----
$ ./minikube-helper.sh setup-prod-infra
