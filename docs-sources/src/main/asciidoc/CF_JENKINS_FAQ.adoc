=== I ran out of resources!! (Cloud Foundry)

[jenkins-cf-resources]] When deploying the app to stage or prod you can get an exception `Insufficient resources`. The way to
 solve it is to kill some apps from test / stage env. To achieve that just call

[source,bash]
----
cf target -o pcfdev-org -s pcfdev-test
cf stop github-webhook
cf stop github-eureka
cf stop stubrunner
----

You can also execute `./tools/pcfdev-helper.sh kill-all-apps` that will remove all demo-related apps
deployed to PCF dev.

=== Deploying to test / stage / prod fails - error finding space (Cloud Foundry)

If you receive a similar exception:

[source,bash]
----
20:26:18 API endpoint:   https://api.local.pcfdev.io (API version: 2.58.0)
20:26:18 User:           user
20:26:18 Org:            pcfdev-org
20:26:18 Space:          No space targeted, use 'cf target -s SPACE'
20:26:18 FAILED
20:26:18 Error finding space pcfdev-test
20:26:18 Space pcfdev-test not found
----

It means that you've forgotten to <<jenkins_pcfdev,create the spaces>> in your PCF Dev installation.

=== The route is already in use (Cloud Foundry)

If you play around with Jenkins / Concourse you might end up with the routes occupied

[source,bash]
----
Using route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io
Binding github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io to github-webhook...
FAILED
The route github-webhook-test.local.pcfdev.io is already in use.
----

Just delete the routes

[source,bash]
----
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n stubrunner-test
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-stage
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-webhook-prod
yes | cf delete-route local.pcfdev.io -n github-eureka-prod
----

You can also execute the `./tools/pcfdev-helper.sh delete-routes`
