check out the slides by https://twitter.com/ciberkleid[Cora Iberkleid] where she
migrates a set of applications to be compliant with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

=== Introduction

This tutorial covers refactoring applications to be compatible with, and take advantage of, Spring Cloud Pipelines.

As an example, we use a simple three-tier application, shown in the following image:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_logical.png[title="Use Case - Logical View"]

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to quickly create a Concourse pipeline for each application and run successfully through a full lifecycle, from source code commit to production deployment, following the lifecycle stages for testing and deployment recommended by Spring Cloud Pipelines. You will be able to improve application code bases with organized test coverage, a contract-based API, and a versioned database schema, letting Spring Cloud Pipelines carry out stubbed testing and ensure backward compatibility for API and database schema changes.

=== Sample Application -- Initial State

The sample application is implemented by using Spring Boot applications for the UI and service tiers and MySQL for the database.

The apps are built with Maven and manually pushed to Cloud Foundry. They leverage the three Pivotal Spring Cloud Services: Config Server, Service Discovery, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard. We use Rabbit to propagate Config Server refresh triggers.

The source code for the two Spring Boot applications is stored on GitHub, as is the backing repo for Config Server.

The following image shows an implementation view of the applications and their ancillary services:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_implementation.png[title="Use Case - Implementation"]

=== Sample Application -- End State

Throughout this tutorial, we add Concourse and JFrog Bintray to manage the application lifecycle.

We also refactor the applications so that they become compatible with Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements and recommendations, including adding and organizing tests and introducing database versioning by using Flyway and introducing API contracts by using Spring Cloud Contract.

=== Tutorial -- Toolset

Throughout this tutorial, we use the following tools:

* *GitHub*: Sample application source code and configuration repositories, a sample stubrunner application repository, and the Spring Cloud Pipelines code base, including the following:
** https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[`greeting-ui`]
** https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[`fortune-service`]
** https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[`app-confi`g]
** https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[`cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`]
** https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines[`spring-cloud-pipelines`]
* *Pivotal Web Services*: Publicly hosted Cloud Foundry offering http://run.pivotal.io[free trial accounts] and including MySQL, Rabbit, and Pivotal Spring Cloud Services in the Marketplace
* *Concourse*
* *JFrog Bintray*: Publicly hosted Maven repository offering free https://bintray.com/signup/oss[OSS accounts]
* *Client Tools*: On your local machine, you need an IDE as well as the mvn, git, cf, and fly (Concourse) CLIs

=== Tutorial -- Overview

We separate the migration steps into three stages:

. *Scaffolding*
** Minimal refactoring to be compatible with basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements.
** At the end of this stage, each application has a corresponding pipeline on Concourse. The pipelines successfully build the applications, store the artifacts in Bintray, tag the GitHub repositories, and deploy the applications to the Test, Stage, and Prod spaces in Cloud Foundry.
. *Tests*
** Add and organize tests to be compatible with Spring Cloud Pipelines recommendations.
** Incorporate flyway for database schema versioning and initial data loading.
** At the end of this stage, the pipelines trigger unit and integration tests during the Build stage, smoke tests in the Test environment, and end-to-end tests in the Stage environment. The pipelines also ensure backward compatibility for the database, such that you can safely roll back the backend service application, even after the database schema has been updated.
. *Contracts*
** Incorporate Spring Cloud Contract to define the API between the UI and service apps and auto-generate tests and stubs.
** At the end of this stage, the pipelines catch breaking API changes during the Build stage and ensure backward compatibility for the API, such that you can safely roll back the backend service (producer) app, even after an API change.

=== Tutorial -- Step-by-step

The remainder of this chapter is the actual tutorial, which consists of a preparation stage and three main stages:

* <<tutorial-prep>>
* <<tutorial-stage-one>>
* <<tutorial-stage-two>>
* <<tutorial-stage-three>>

[[tutorial-prep]]
==== Prep: Before you begin

If you want to simply review the migration steps explained below, you can look at the various branches in the https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui] and https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service] repositories. A branch represents the end-state of each stage, as the following image shows:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/github_branches.png[title="GitHub Branches"]

If you want to use this tutorial as a hands-on lab, fork each of the following repositories:

* https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui]
* https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service]
* https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config]

Then create a new directory on your local machine. You may name it anything you like. We refer to it as `$SCP_HOME` throughout this tutorial.

In `$SCP_HOME`, clone your forks of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, as well as the following two repositories:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines[spring-cloud-pipelines]

Finally, create a directory called `$SCP_HOME/credentials`. Leave it empty for now.

[[tutorial-stage-one]]
==== Stage One: Scaffolding

In this stage, we make minimal changes to satisfy basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements so that the applications can run through the entire pipeline without error. We make "`scaffolding`" changes only -- no code changes.

IMPORTANT: You must complete the steps in this stage for both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`.

===== 1.1 Create GitHub Branches

Create branches in GitHub by using the following git commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
git branch version
git checkout -b sc-pipelines
----
====
The `version` branch is required to exist, though it can be created as an empty branch. It is used by Spring Coud Pipelines to generate a version number for each new pipeline execution.

The `sc-pipelines` branch is optional and can be named anything you wish. The intention is for you to use it as a working branch for the changes suggested in this tutorial (hence, you should both create it and check it out).

===== 1.2 Add Maven Wrapper

This step covers how to add the Maven wrapper (which lets your users build without having Maven on the path). To add the Maven wrapper, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
----
====

This commands adds four files to a project:

====
[source]
----
.
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
└── .mvn
    └── wrapper
        ├── maven-wrapper.jar
        └── maven-wrapper.properties
----
====

Make sure all four files are tracked by Git. One way to do so is to add the following lines to the `.gitignore` file:

====
[source]
----
#Exceptions
!/mvnw
!/mvnw.cmd
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
----
====

===== 1.3 Create the Bintray Maven Repository Package

We use Bintray as the Maven repository. Bintray requires that a package exist before any application artifacts can be uploaded.

Log into the Bintray UI and create the packages as follows (you can use the "`Import from GitHub`" option to create these):

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/bintray_packages.png[title="Bintray Packages"]

===== 1.4 Configure Distribution Management by Using the Bintray Maven Repository

IMPORTANT: You must do this step for both application repositories.

Edit the application `pom.xml` files. Make sure that the Bintray URLs match the URLs of the corresponding packages created in the previous step. The values you use should differ from the following example in that they should point to your repository:

====
[source,xml]
----
<properties>
...
<distribution.management.release.id>bintray</distribution.management.release.id>
<distribution.management.release.url>https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service</distribution.management.release.url>
</properties>

...

<distributionManagement>
<repository>
<id>${distribution.management.release.id}</id>
<url>${distribution.management.release.url}</url>
</repository>
</distributionManagement>
----
====

Though not required by Spring Cloud Pipelines, it makes sense to also configure your local maven settings with the credentials to your Bintray maven repository. To do so, edit your maven settings file (usually `~/.m2/settings.xml`). If the file does not exist, create it.

Note that the `id` must match the `id` specified in the previous step. Also, make sure to use your username and API token (not your account password) instead of the sample values shown in the following example:

====
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>bintray</id>
      <username>ciberkleid</username>
      <password>my-super-secret-api-token</password>
   </server>
 </servers>
</settings>
----
====

===== 1.5 Push Changes to GitHub

Push the changes you made in the preceding step to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two application repositories:

* Four new Maven wrapper files
* A modified `.gitignore` file
* A modified `pom.xml` file

===== 1.6 Add a Spring Cloud Pipelines Credentials File

In `$SCP_HOME/credentials`, make two copies of the `$SCP_HOME/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/credentials-sample-cf.yml` file. Rename them as `credentials-fortune-service.yml` and `credentials-greeting-ui.yml`.

CAUTION: These files will contain credentials to your GitHub repository, your Bintray repository, and your Cloud Foundry foundation. Hence, we opt to put them in a separate directory. You may choose to store these files in a private Git repository, but do not push them to a public repository.

Edit the Git properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown in our example. For `tools-branch`, you can use a fixed release (use v1.0.0.M8 or later for Cloud Foundry). Leave the other values as they are. We update those in later steps. The following listing shows a credentials file:

====
[source,yml]
----
app-url: git@github.com:ciberkleid/fortune-service.git
app-branch: sc-pipelines
tools-scripts-url: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
tools-branch: master
build-options: ""

github-private-key: |

  ...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
git-email: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
git-name: Cora Iberkleid
----
====

Edit the Maven repository properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown in our example. Bintray requires separate URLs for uploads and downloads. If you use a different artifact repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus, and the repository URL is the same for uploads and downloads, you do not need to set `repo-with-binaries-for-upload`. The following listing shows the values to add or edit in your credentials file:

====
[source,yml]
----
m2-settings-repo-id: bintray
m2-settings-repo-username: ciberkleid
m2-settings-repo-password: my-super-secret-api-token

repo-with-binaries: https://ciberkleid:my-super-secret-api-token@dl.bintray.com/ciberkleid/maven-repo

repo-with-binaries-for-upload: https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service
----
====

===== 1.7 Set the Concourse Pipeline

At this point, all of the build jobs, which run on Concourse workers, should succeed.

To verify this, log in to your Concourse target and set the Concourse pipelines. Update the target name in the following example:

====
[source,bash]
----
# Set greeting-ui pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p greeting-ui -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-greeting-ui.yml" -n

# Set fortune-service pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p fortune-service -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-fortune-service.yml" -n
----
====

Log into the Concourse UI and un-pause the pipelines. Start each pipeline. You should see that the build jobs all succeed, similar to the following image:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_build_success.png[title="Build Success"]

In addition, you should see a new `dev/<version_number>` tag in each GitHub repository and see the app jars uploaded into Bintray.

The test, stage, and prod jobs fail, because we have not yet added scaffolding for deployment to Cloud Foundry. We do that next.

===== 1.8 Add Cloud Foundry manifest

If you are deploying to Cloud Foundry, you may already be routinely including manifest files with your applications. Our sample applications did not have manifest files, so we add them now.

In the `greeting-ui` repository, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: greeting-ui
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

In the `fortune-service` repository, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

The `TRUST_CERTS` variable is used by the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services (Config Server, Service Registry, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard), which we use in this example. The value specified in the preceding example assumes deployment to Pivotal Web Services. Update it accordingly if you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, or you can leave it out altogether if you are replacing the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services with alternative implementations (for example, deploying the services as applications and exposing them as user-provided services).

If you wishi, you can add additional values to the manifest files -- for example, if additional values are useful for any manual deployment you may still want to do or if you need additional values in your Spring Cloud Pipelines deployment. For example, the following file could be an alternative `manifest.yml` for `fortune-service`:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  instances: 3
  memory: 1024M
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
  random-route: true
  path: ./target/fortune-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: someProfile
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

Note that Spring Cloud Pipelines ignores `random-route` and `path`. `instances` is honored in stage and prod but is overridden with a value of 1 for test.

===== 1.9 Add the Spring Cloud Pipelines Manifest

The Cloud Foundry manifest created in the previous step includes the logical names of the services to which the applications should be bound, but it does not describe how the services can be provisioned. Hence, we add a second manifest file so that Spring Cloud Pipelines can provision the services.

Add a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` to each application and include the same list of services as in the corresponding `manifest.yml`. Add the necessary details such that Spring Cloud Pipelines can construct a `cf create-service` command.

NOTE: The `type: broker' parameter in the next example instructs Spring Cloud Pipelines to provision a service by using `cf create-service'. Other service types are also supported: cups, syslog, route, app, and stubrunner.

More specifically, for `greeting-ui`, create an `sc-pipelines.yml` file with the following content:

====
[source,yml]
----
test:
  services:
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
----
====

The `sc-pipelines.yml` file for `fortune-service` is similar, with the addition of the `fortune-db` service, as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
test:
  # list of required services
  services:
    - name: fortune-db
      type: broker
      broker: cleardb
      plan: spark
      useExisting: true
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
----
====

The values in the preceding two examples assume deployment to Pivotal Web Services. If you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, update the values accordingly. Also, make sure to replace the `config-server` URI with the address of your fork of the https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[`app-config`] repository.

TIP: Notice the `useExisting: true` parameter in the preceding example. By default, Spring Cloud Pipelines deletes and re-creates services in the `test` space. To override this behavior and re-use existing services, we set `useExisting: true`. This is helpful in cases where services  may take time to provision and initialize, where there is no risk in re-using them between pipeline runs, or where it is desirable to retain the service instance from the last pipeline run (for example, a database migration).

===== 1.10 Push changes to GitHub

Push the preceding changes to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two application repositories:

* A new app manifest file
* A new sc-pipelines manifest file

===== 1.11 Create Cloud Foundry Orgs and Spaces

Spring Cloud Pipelines requires that the Cloud Foundry test, stage, and prod spaces exist before a pipeline is run. If you wish, you can use different foundations, orgs, and users for each. For simplicity, in this example, we use a single foundation (PWS), a single org, and a single user.


You can name the orgs and spaces anything you like. Each app requires its own test space. The stage and prod spaces are shared.

For this example, use the following commands to create spaces:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf create-space scp-test-greeting-ui
cf create-space scp-test-fortune-service
cf create-space scp-stage
cf create-space scp-prod
----
====

===== 1.12 Create Cloud Foundry Stage and Prod Service Instances

Spring Cloud Pipelines dynamically creates the services in the test spaces, as defined by the `sc-pipelines.yml` file we created previously. Optionally, you can add a second section to the `sc-pipelines.yml` file for the stage environment, and these are created dynamically as well. However, you must always crate prod manually.

For this example, we create both the stage and prod services manually.

Create the services listed in the application manifest files in both `scp-stage` and `scp-prod`.

===== 1.13 Update the Spring Cloud Pipelines Credentials File

Update the `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` credentials files with Cloud Foundry information. Replace values in the next example as appropriate for your Cloud Foundry environment.

Notice that the test space name specified is a prefix, unlike the stage and prod space names, which are literals. Spring Cloud Pipelines append the application name to the test space name, thereby matching the test space names we created manually. The stage and prod space names are not prefixes and are not altered by Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Note also the `paas-hostname-uuid`. The value is included in each created route. This value is optional, but it is useful in shared or multi-tenant environments (such as PWS), as it helps to ensure routes are unique. Change it to a unique uuid.

The following example shows an updated credentials file:

====
[source,yml]
----
pipeline-descriptor: sc-pipelines.yml

paas-type: cf

paas-hostname-uuid: cyi

# test values
paas-test-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-test-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-test-password: secret
paas-test-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-test-space-prefix: scp-test

# stage values
paas-stage-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-stage-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-stage-password: my-super-secret-password
paas-stage-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-stage-space: scp-stage

# prod values
paas-prod-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-prod-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-prod-password: my-super-secret-password
paas-prod-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-prod-space: scp-prod
----
====

===== 1.14 Update the Concourse Pipeline with Updated Credentials Files

Set the Concourse pipelines again, as we did previously, to update them with the values added to the credentials files. The test, stage, and prod jobs should all now succeed and result in output similar to the following image:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_test_stage_prod_success.png[title="Test, Stage, & Prod Success"]

On Cloud Foundry, you should now see the apps deployed in the test, stage, and prod spaces. The following image shows the deployment of `fortune-service` to its dedicated test space:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/cf_test_and_prod_deployed.png[title="Cloud Foundry Test and Prod Deployment"]

Notice that the five services declared in its manifest files (`sc-pipelines.yml` for provisioning and `manifest.yml` for binding) have also been automatically provisioned. The image also shows the deployment of the same app to the shared prod space. Notice that the instance of the previous version has been renamed as `venerable` and stopped. If a rollback were deemed necessary, the `prod-rollback` job in the pipeline could be triggered to remove the currently running version, remove the `prod/<version_number>` tag from GitHub, and re-start the former (`venerable`) version.

===== Stage One Recap and Next Steps

What have we accomplished?

* By adding the basic scaffolding needed to enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to manage the lifecycle of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` from source code commit to production deploy, we have made it possible for the application development teams to instantly and easily create pipelines for each application by using a common, standardized template.
* We can count on the pipelines to:
** Automatically provision services in test spaces and, optionally, in stage spaces as well.
** Dynamically clean up the test spaces between pipeline executions.
** Upload the app artifacts to the maven repo (for example, Bintray).
** Tag the git repositories with `dev/<version_number>` and `prod/<version_number>`.
* After each successful pipeline run, we can, if necessary, to roll back to the last deployed version byusing the `prod-rollback` job.

These accomplishments are extremely valuable. However, to derive confidence and reliability from the pipelines, we need to incorporate testing. We do this in Stage Two of the application migration.

[[tutorial-stage-two]]
==== Stage Two: Tests

In this stage, we enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to execute tests so that we can increase confidence in the code being deployed. We do so by adding test profiles to the `pom.xml` files and then organizing or adding tests in a way that corresponds to the profiles. By doing so, we establish standards around testing across development teams in the enterprise.

We will also enable database schema versioning in this stage, thereby providing the foundation for rollback testing during schema changes.

===== 2.1 Add Maven Profiles

For both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, add a `profiles` section to the `pom.xml` file, as shown in the next listing. Note that we are adding four profiles:

* `default`
** For unit and integration tests. Note that this profile includes all tests except those that are explicitly called by the smoke and e2e profiles.
** Tests matching this profile run during the build-and-upload job.
* `apicompatibility`
** For ensuring backward compatibility in case of API changes. Note that this is not effective until Stage Three, when we will add contracts. However, we add this profile now to ensure the api compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job does not run other tests.
* `smoke`
** For tests to be run against the application deployed in the test space.
* `e2e`
** For tests to be run against the application deployed in the stage space.

The following listing shows the necessary `profiles` element of a `pom.xml` file:

====

===== 2.2 Add and Organize Tests

Next, we ensure that we have a matching test package structure in our apps, as the following image shows:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/test_package_structure.png[title="Test Package Structure"]

Note that we are creating matching packages only for the default, smoke, and e2e profiles. We will address the package for the `apicompatibility` profile in Stage Three.

When working with your own applications, if you have existing tests, you would move the files into one of these packages now and rename them so that they are included by the filters declared in the profiles (that is, the file names end in `Test.java` or `Tests.java`)

In the case of our sample apps, we have no tests, so we add some now.

====== `fortune-service` Default Tests

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile, as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These are run on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application that runs on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we add two tests, one that loads the context and another that verifies the number of rows expected in the database. The following example defines these tests:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = FortuneServiceApplication.class)
public class FortuneServiceApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate template;

    @Test
    public void testDefaultSettings() throws Exception {
        assertThat(this.template.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) from FORTUNE",
                Integer.class)).isEqualTo(7);
    }

}
----
====

====== `fortune-service` Smoke Tests

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile, as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-fortune-service` space. Two versions of these tests are executed against the application:

* the current version, in the `test-smoke` job.
* the latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_smoke_tests.png[title="fortune-service Smoke Tests"]

In the test environment, we choose to verify that `fortune-service` is retrieving a fortune from `fortune-db`, and not returning its Hystrix fallback response. The following example defines this test:

====
[source,java]
----
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
----
====

====== `fortune-service` End-to-end (`e2e`) Tests

Add your end-to-end tests so that they match the `e2e` profile, as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These tests run on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `greeting-ui` is also present.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_e2e_tests.png[title="fortune-service E2E Tests"]

In the `e2e` environment, we choose to use a string replacement to obtain the URL for `greeting-ui`. We also choose to verify that we hit `fortune-db` and do not receive Hystrix fallback responses from either application. The following example shows this test:

====
[source,java]
----
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

	// The app is running in CF but the tests are executed from Concourse worker,
	// so the test will deduce the url to greeting-ui: it will assume the same host
	// as fortune-service, and simply replace "fortune-service" with "greeting-ui" in the url

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl.replace("fortune-service", "greeting-ui") + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback responses from both fortune and greeting
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.").doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
----
====

====== `greeting-ui` Default Tests

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile, as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application that runs on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we add one test that loads the context:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class)
public class GreetingUIApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

}
----
====

====== `greeting-ui` Smoke Tests

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile, as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-greeting-ui` space. Two versions of these tests run against the app:

* The current version, in the `test-smoke` job.
* The latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_smoke_tests.png[title="greeting-ui Smoke Tests"]

Since `fortune-service` is not deployed to the `scp-test-greeting-ui` space, we expect to receive the Hystrix fallback response defined in `greeting-ui`. Hence, our smoke test validates that condition:

====
[source,java]
----
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

    @Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void should_return_a_fallback_fortune() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
                .getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

        BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

        // Expect the hystrix fallback response
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).contains("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
    }

}
----
====

====== `greeting-ui` End-to-end (`e2e`) Tests

Add your end-to-end tests so that they match the `e2e` profile, as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These run on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `fortune-service` is also present.

The following image shows the tests in Concourse:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_e2e_tests.png[title="greeting-ui E2E Tests"]

In the `e2e` environment, we choose to verify that we hit `fortune-service` and do not receive the Hystrix fallback response from `greeting-ui`. The following example shows the test:

====
[source,java]
----
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
	}

}
----
====

===== 2.3 Enable Database Versioning

At this point, we also incorporate https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway], an OSS database migration tool, to track database schema versions and handle schema changes and data loading.

This change needs to be made only to `fortune-service`, since `fortune-service` owns the interaction with `fortune-db`.

====== Add Flyway Dependency

We first add the Flyway dependency to the `fortune-service` `pom.xml`. We need not add a version as Spring Boot takes care of that for us. The following listing shows the Flyway dependency:

====
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
      <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
----
====

====== Create Flyway Migration

Next, we create a migration directory and our initial migration file, following Flyway's file naming convention. The following image shows the name of the file in context:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_file_name.png[title="fortune-service Flyway File Name"]

Note that the filename specifies the version (`V1`), followed by two underscore characters.

We place our `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements in our `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql` file, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE fortune (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  text varchar(255) not null
);

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do what works.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do the right thing.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Always be kind.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You can always find happiness at work on Friday.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You will be hungry again in one hour.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Today will be an awesome day!');
----
====

====== Disable JPA DDL Initialization

Because we rely on Flyway to create and populate the schema, we need to disable JPA-based database initialization. We can set `ddl-auto` to `validate`, which validates the schema against the application entities and throws an error in case of a mismatch but does not actually generate the schema. The following snippet shows how to do so:

====
[source,yml]
----
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
----
====

There are a few options for where to store the `ddl-auto` configuration, both in terms of location (in the `fortune-service` app or on the `app-config` GitHub repo) and in terms of file name. For this example, update the `application.yml` in the `fortune-service` app for local testing. Additionally, save these values in a new file called `application-flyway.yml` on your fork of https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[`app-config`].

By convention, `fortune-service` picks up the configurations in `application-flyway.yml` if the string `flyway` is in the list of active Spring profiles. Consequently, we can add `flyway` to the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable in the `fortune-service` `manifest.yml`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: flyway
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

====== Remove Non-Flyway Data Loading

We can now remove the old code that populated the database. In our sample app, this was found in the `io.pivotal.FortuneServiceApplication` class. The following listing shows the code we now remove:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
    CommandLineRunner loadDatabase(FortuneRepository fortuneRepo) {
        return args -> {
//            logger.debug("loading database..");
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(1L, "Do what works."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(2L, "Do the right thing."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(3L, "Always be kind."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(4L, "You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(5L, "You can always find happiness at work on Friday."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(6L, "You will be hungry again in one hour."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(7L, "Today will be an awesome day!"));
            logger.debug("record count: {}", fortuneRepo.count());
            fortuneRepo.findAll().forEach(x -> logger.debug(x.toString()));
        };

    }
----
====

We also no longer need the `Fortune` entity constructors, so we can comment these out in the `io.pivotal.fortune.Fortune` class as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
//    public Fortune() {
//    }
//
//    public Fortune(Long id, String text) {
//        super();
//        this.id = id;
//        this.text = text;
//    }
----
====

====== Flyway Integration Summary

With that, we have completed the setup for Flyway, and our database schema is now versioned. From this point onward, Spring Boot calls `Flyway.migrate()` to perform the database migration. As long as we follow Flyway conventions for future schema changes, Flyway takes care of tracking the schema version and migrating the database for us.

From a rollback perspective, Spring Cloud Pipelines includes two jobs in the `test` phase (`test-rollback-deploy` and `test-rollback-smoke`), wherein it validates that the latest prod jar works against the newly updated database. The purpose is to ensure that we can roll back the application in prod if a problem is discovered after the prod database schema has been updated and avoid the burden of rolling back the database.

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html#howto-use-a-higher-level-database-migration-tool[Spring Boot database initialization with Flyway] for further information, including Flyway configuration options.

===== 2.4 Push Changes to GitHub

For `greeting-ui`, you should push the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/GreetingUIApplicationTests.java`
* `src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java`


For `fortune-service`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplicationTests.java`
* `src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java`
* `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql`
* `src/main/resources/application.yml`
* `manifest.yml`
* `src/main/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplication.java`
* `src/main/java/io/pivotal/fortune/Fortune.java`

For `app-config`, you should be pushing the following new:

* `application-flyway.yml`


===== 2.5 Re-run the Pipelines

Run through the pipelines again and view the output for the jobs that run the default, smoke, and end-to-end (`e2e`) tests. You should see that the tests we added in this stage were run.

As you run through the pipelines a second time, you should see the smoke tests from the latest prod version run against the database in the `test-rollback-smoke` job. In this case, there is no schema upgrade. Nonetheless, the tests confirm that the latest prod version of the app can be used with the current database schema.

You can see the database version information stored in the database by Flyway either by querying the database itself or by hitting the flyway endpoint on the `fortune-service` URL. The following image shows an example from the `scp-stage` environment:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_schema_info.png[title="fortune-service Flyway Schema Info"]

===== Stage Two Recap and Next Steps

What have we accomplished?

* Increased the effectiveness of the pipelines and our confidence in them by integrating our applications with the testing strategy built into Spring Cloud Pipelines.
* Established a standard approach to organizing tests, which brings consistency within and across development teams.
* Enabled auto-managed database versioning and backward compatibility testing that alleviates database schema management throughout the release management lifecycle.

We can now add any unit, integration, smoke, and end-to-end tests to our code base and have a high level of reliability and confidence in our pipelines. We are also better positioned to ensure that our development teams conform to these practices, given the structure established by Spring Cloud Pipelines and the fast feedback and visibility we gain from the pipelines as they execute the tests.

However, we could benefit further by incorporating contracts to define and test the API integration points between applications. We do this in Stage Three of the application migration.

[[tutorial-stage-three]]
==== Stage Three: Contracts

In this stage, we introduce contract-based programming practices into our sample application. Doing so improves API management capabilities, including defining, communicating, and testing API semantics. It also lets us catch breaking API changes (that is, we can validate API backward compatibility) in the build phase. This extends the effectiveness of the pipelines, encourages better communication and programming practices across development teams, and provides faster feedback to developers.

We will integrate Spring Cloud Contract and add contracts, stubs, and a stub runner. We will also now complete and make use of the `apicompatibility` profile defined in <<tutorial-stage-two>>.

===== 3.1 Create a Contract

We start by creating the contract for the interaction between `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`. The contract should describe the following expectation: `greeting-ui` makes a `GET` request to the root URL of `fortune-service` and expects a response with status 200 and a string (`new fortune`) in the body

We code this buy using groovy syntax as follows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    description("""
should return a fortune string
""")
    request {
        method GET()
        url "/"
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body "new fortune"
    }
}
----
====

Save this contract in the `fortune-service` code base in the following location (which is compliant with Spring Cloud Contract convention): `src/test/resources/contracts/<service-name>/<contract-file>`. The following image shows the contract file in its location within an IDE:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_contract_file.png[title="fortune-service Flyway Contract File"]

[NOTE]
=====
You can optionally enable your IDE to assist with contract syntax by adding the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to your `pom.xml` file. It is pluggable, and includes groovy and pact by default. The following element shows the dependency to add:

====
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
----
====
=====

===== 3.2 Create a Base Class for Contract Tests

Now that we have a coded contract, we want to enable auto-generation of contract-based tests. The auto-generation, which we will configure in the next steps, requires a base class that stubs out the service that satisfies the API call, so that we can run the test without external dependencies (for example, the database). The objective is to focus on testing API semantics.

We create the base class in the `fortune-service` test package as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.fortune;

import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.mockito.BDDMockito;

public class BaseClass {

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        FortuneService service = BDDMockito.mock(FortuneService.class);
        BDDMockito.given(service.getFortune()).willReturn("foo fortune");
        RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new FortuneController(service));
    }
}
----
====

===== 3.3 Enable Automated Contract-based Testing

Now that we have a contract and a base class, we can use the Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin to auto-generate contract tests, stubs, and a stub jar.

First we add the Spring Cloud Contract version to the list of properties in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file, since we will reference it when we enable the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin. To do so, we add the `<spring-cloud-contract.version>` to the `properties` element, as follows:

====
[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
...
    <spring-cloud-contract.version>1.2.1.RELEASE</spring-cloud-contract.version>
...
</properties>
----
====

Next, we edit the `default` profile in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file to:

* Add a plugin block for Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin.
* Configure it to use our base class (`io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass`) to generate tests.
* Configure it to place auto-generated tests in the `io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests` test package.

Note that the package of the contract tests is included by the `include` filter in the `default` profile, so these tests run against the application during the `build-and-upload` job. For `fortune-service`, this serves to validate that the application conforms to the contract.

The following listing shows the complete profile:

====
[source,xml]
----
    <profile>
      <id>default</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>

When the app is built, the Spring Cloud Contract maven plugin also now produces a stub and a stub jar that contains the contract and stub. This stub jar is uploaded to Bintray, along with the usual app jar. As we see shortly, this stub jar can be used by the `greeting-ui` development team while they wait for `fortune-service` to be completed. In other words, this gives the `greeting-ui` development team a producer to test against that is based on a mutually agreed-upon contract without the lead time of having to wait for `fortune-service` team to implement anything more than a base class and without having to manually stub out calls to `fortune-service` based on arbitrary or static responses.

TIP: Package the project locally (run `mvn package`) to observe the tests, stubs, and stub jar that the Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin generates. See the following image for reference:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_generated_tests.png[title="Generated Tests and Stubs"]

===== 3.4 Enable backward compatibility API check

To enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to catch any breaking API changes during the the API compatibility check in the `build-and-upload` job, we add the Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin to the `apicompatibility` profile as well.

In this case, we want the plugin to generate tests based on contracts outside of the project (the ones from the latest prod version), so we configure the plugin to download the latest prod stub jar, which contains the old contract. The plugin uses the old contract and the specified base class (which, in our example, is the same as the one in the previous step) to generate contract tests. These tests are run against the new code to validate that it is still compatible with consumers that comply with the prior contract. This ensures backward compatibility for the API.

In short, we edit the `apicompatibility` profile in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file to:

* Add a plugin block for Spring Cloud Contract Maven plugin.
* Configure it to download the latest prod stub jar from Bintray to obtain the old contract.
* Configure it to use our base class (`io.pivotal.fortune.BaseClass`) to generate tests (we use the same one as in the prior step).
* Configure it to place auto-generated tests in the `io.pivotal.fortune.contracttests` test package.

Note that the package of the contract tests matches the `include` filter in the `apicompatibility` profile, so these tests run against the app during the the API compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job. For `fortune-service`, this serves to validate that the app conforms to the old contract.

The following listing shows the complete profile:

Spring Cloud Pipelines dynamically injects the values for `${repo.with.binaries}` and `${latest.production.version}`. You can run this locally by providing these values manually as system properties in the Maven command.

===== 3.5 Push Changes to GitHub

All changes in Stage Three thus far are in `fortune-service`. At this point, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `src/test/resources/contracts/greeting-ui/shouldReturnAFortune.groovy`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/fortune/BaseClass.java`

===== 3.6 Re-run the `fortune-service` Pipeline

Run through the `fortune-service` pipeline to generate stubs. The following output from the `build-and-upload` job shows the auto-generation of tests and stubs:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_build_and_upload_test_and_stub_generation.png[title="fortune-service build-and-upload Test and Stub Generation"]

You should also see output in the `build-and-upload` job that shows the execution of these tests against the code.

Additionally, you should see the stub jar uploaded to Bintray along with the usual app jar.

Finally, as you run through the pipeline a second time, you should see that the contract tests from the latest prod version run against the new code in the output of the the API compatibility check during the `build-and-upload` job. In this case, there is no API change. Nonetheless, the tests confirm that the latest prod version of the API can be used with the current code base.

===== 3.7 Enable Stubs for Integration Tests

Now we turn our attention to `greeting-ui`.

The following image compares the path of a request through `greeting-ui` in the build phase, both with and without stubs:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_build_flow.png[title="greeting-ui Build Flow"]

Without stubs, we expect the response to be the Hystrix fallback response that is hard-coded in `greeting-ui`. With stubs, however, we can expect the response that was declared in the contract. In this case, the stubs are loaded into the `greeting-ui` process. This leads us to our next task: Loading the stubs produced by `fortune-service`.

====== Enable the in-process Stub Runner

To load the stubs into the `greeting-ui` process, we must enable the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner dependency. This dependency start ans in-process stub runner that automatically configures Wiremock.

Add the following dependency to the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
 <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
====

====== Add Integration Tests Aligned with the Contract

Next, we add integration tests to `greeting-ui` to test for the expected response declared in the contract.

Add the following class to the `test` package in `greeting-ui`:

====
[source,java]
----
package io.pivotal.fortune;

import io.pivotal.GreetingUIApplication;
import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.cloud.contract.stubrunner.spring.AutoConfigureStubRunner;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class, webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE,
        properties = {"spring.application.name=greeting-ui", "spring.cloud.circuit.breaker.enabled=false", "hystrix.stream.queue.enabled=false"})
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"io.pivotal:fortune-service:1.0.0.M1-20180102_203542-VERSION"},
        repositoryRoot = "${REPO_WITH_BINARIES}"
        //workOffline = true
)

public class FortuneServiceTests {

    @Autowired FortuneService fortuneService;

    @Test
    public void shouldSendRequestToFortune() {
        // when
        String fortune = fortuneService.getFortune();
        // then
        BDDAssertions.then(fortune).isEqualTo("foo fortune");
    }

}
----
====

At this point, we can get through the build phase for `greeting-ui`, and the integration tests run against the `fortune-service` stubs that runs in the `greeting-ui` process on the Concourse worker.

TIP: Notice the configuration of `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`. You can replace the version with a `+` sign if using Artifactory or Nexus and it automatically chooses the latest available version on the maven repo.

TIP: Setting `workOffline=true` (commented out but shown earlier for informational purposes) would make the stub runner get the stubs from the local Maven repository. This is useful for local testing. Alternatively, set the `$REPO_WITH_BINARIES` environment variable to the value used in the credentials file before doing a local Maven build. Then the local build will download the stubs from your remote Maven repository (for example, Bintray).

===== 3.8 Enable Stubs for Smoke Tests

The following image compares the path of a request through `greeting-ui` in the test phase, both with and without stubs. Note that in the build phase, where the app process runS on the Concourse worker, we ran the stubs in the same process. In the test environment (Cloud Foundry), we run the stubs in a separate process by using a standalone stub runner application. The following image shows the test flow for the `greeting-ui` application:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_test_flow.png[title="greeting-ui Test Flow"]

As in the build phase, without stubs, we expect the response to be the Hystrix fallback response that is hard-coded in `greeting-ui`. With stubs, however, we can expect the response that was declared in the contract.

We rely on Spring Cloud Pipelines to:

* Deploy a stub runner application.
* Provide the stub runner application with the necessary information to download the stubs.
* Open a port on the stub runner application for each stub.

We rely on the stub runner application to:

* Download the stubs from our Maven repository (Bintray).
* Expose each stub on a separate port.
* Register each stub in the Service Discovery server.

The following steps describe how to configure stubs for smoke tests.

====== Provide a Stand-alone Stub Runner App Jar

In the <<tutorial-prep,Prep step>> for this tutorial, you cloned the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[`cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`] repo to your local machine. The next step is to build this application and upload it to Bintray to make the jar available to Spring Cloud Pipelines.

As mentioned in <<tutorial-stage-one>> of this tutorial, Bintray requires that a package exist before any application artifacts can be uploaded. Log into the Bintray UI and create a package for `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot`. If you forked this repo, you can use the `Import from GitHub` option. Otherwise, create the package manually and choose any license (for example, Apache 2.0).

Now you are ready to build and upload this app to Bintray. Edit the following script (which shows cloning, building, and uploading) to match your Bintray URL, the Bintray ID in your `~/.m2/settings/xml` file, and the `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot` repository URL (if you chose to fork it):

====
[source,bash]
----
# Edit to match your Bintray URL and M2 repo ID setting (check your ~/.m2/settings.xml file)
MAVEN_REPO_URL=https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot
MAVEN_REPO_ID=bintray

# Clone cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot.git
cd cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot

# Build and upload
./mvnw clean deploy -Ddistribution.management.release.url="${MAVEN_REPO_URL}" -Ddistribution.management.release.id="${MAVEN_REPO_ID}"
----
====

You should now see the `cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot` artifacts uploaded on Bintray.

====== Provide Stand-alone Stub Runner Application Manifest

Next, we add a manifest file for the stub runner application for deployment to Cloud Foundry.

Place this file in the `greeting-ui` repo. The file name and location can be your choice. For this example, we use `sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml`. The following image shows the file in the appropriate folder:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_stubrunner_manifest.png[title="greeting-ui Stub Runner Manifest"]

We populate this `manifest-stubrunner.yml` with the content shown in the next listing so that the stub runner binds to `service-registry`. The stub runner registers the `fortune-service` stub there so that `greeting-ui` can discover it in the same way it discovers the actual `fortune-service` app endpoint in stage and prod. From the `greeting-ui` perspective, there is no difference in how it interacts with Eureka and the stub runner application in test and the way it interacts with Eureka and the `fortune-service` application in stage and prod. The following listing shows the content of `manifest-stubrunner.yml`:

====
[source,yml]
---
applications:
- name: stubrunner
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - service-registry
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
----
====

====== Provide a Stub Runner Jar and Manifest Information to the Pipeline

Now that we have a jar file and a manifest file for our stub runner application, we need to provide this information to our `greeting-ui` pipeline so that the pipeline downloads the jar from Bintray and deploys it to Cloud Foundry. We do this through the `greeting-ui` `sc-pipelines.yml` file. We add an entry to the list of services in the `test` section, as follows:

====
[source,yml]
----
    - name: stubrunner
      type: stubrunner
      coordinates: io.pivotal:cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot:0.0.1.M1
      pathToManifest: sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml
----
====

Notice that `name` matches the name of the application in `manifest-stubrunner.yml`, `coordinates` corresponds to the jar coordinates of the Maven repository, and `pathToManifest` matches our chosen fie name for the stub runner application manifest.

Note also the `type` is set to `stubrunner`, which Spring Cloud Pipelines will recognize as a stanalone stub runner app and treat accordingly.

====== Provide Stub Configuration for the Stub Runner Application

The final steps in the configuration of the stand-alone stub runner app are as follows:

* Enable the stub runner app to download the `fortune-service` stub from Bintray.
* Open a second port on the container to receive requests for this stub.

To accomplish this, we put stub and port configuration information into the properties section of the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file, by using a property called `stubrunner.ids`. This property can accept a list of stubrunner IDs. However, for this tutorial, we only have one, as follows:

====
[source,xml]
----
  <properties>
...
    <!--Tell stub runner app to start this stub-->
    <stubrunner.ids>io.pivotal:fortune-service:1.0.0.M1-20180102_203542-VERSION:stubs:10000</stubrunner.ids>
  </properties>
----
====

Spring Cloud Pipelines uses this information in two ways:

* It provides this information to the stub runner application through the application's environment variables.
** Spring Cloud Pipelines also provides the `$REPO_WITH_BINARIES` as an environment variable for the stub runner application.
** The stub runner application uses this information to download the stub from Bintray and expose it on the specified port.
* It opens the additional port specified on the stub runner app and map a new route to it.
** The format for each route is `<stub-runner-app-name>-<hostname-uuid>-<env>-<app-name>-<port>.<domain>`.
** In our example, this would be `stubrunner-cyi-test-greeting-ui-10000.cfapps.io`.

Since we bound our stub runner application to `service-registry` (Eureka), the stub runner application registers the stub URL under the `FORTUNE-SERVICE` application name on Eureka, as the following image shows:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_stub_runner_eureka_registration.png[title="greeting-ui Stub Runner Eureka Registration"]

This completes the process of configuring the stand-alone stub runner application.

NOTE: You can automate the port configuration by Spring Cloud Pipelines in the future such that you need not include the port in `stubrunner.ids`. However, for the moment, we are required to specify the port each stub should use.

====== Edit Smoke Tests to Align with the Contract

Finally, we edit our smoke tests for `greeting-ui` to ensure the response does not contain the Hystrix fallback, since we are now expecting a response from the stub. The following listing shows the edited smoke tests:

====
[source,java]
----
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
	}

}
----
====

In this case, in contrast to the integration test we created earlier for `greeting-ui`, we do not include `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`, because we are using a standalone stub runner application.

===== 3.9 Push Changes to GitHub

Push contract-based changes for `greeting-ui`. You should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* `pom.xml`
* `sc-pipelines.yml`
* `sc-pipelines/manifest-stubrunner.yml`
* `src/test/java/io/pivotal/fortune/FortuneServiceTests.java`
* `src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java`

At this point, we can run through the full pipeline for `greeting-ui` and leverage the contract-based stub in both the build and test environments.

===== Stage Three Recap

What have we accomplished?

By implementing a contract-driven approach with auto-generation of tests and stubs, we have introduced a clean, structured, and reliable way to define, communicate, document, manage, and test APIs. The benefits include the following:

* Inter-team communication can be simpler.
** Consumer and producer teams can now communicate requirements through coded contracts.
** The inventory of contracts serves as a record and reference of the agreed-upon APIs.
* Developer productivity will increase.
** Producers can quickly and easily generate contract-based stubs.
** Consumers no longer have to manually stub out APIs and write tests with arbitrary hard-coded responses. Instead, they can use the auto-generated stubs and test for contract-based responses.
** Both producers and consumers can validate their code complies with the contract.
** Producers can verify backward compatibility of API changes.
** Troubleshooting will be easier.
** Failure and feedback will be faster.


=== Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial on migrating apps for Spring Cloud Pipelines for Cloud Foundry.

Moving forward, the refactoring work shown here can be incorporated into your and your team's standard practices. We recommend the following practices:

*Good:*

* Use Maven or Gradle wrappers.
* Include a Cloud Foundry manifest file in your application repository.
* Include a pipeline descriptor (`sc-manifest.yml`) in your app repository.
* Create an empty `version` branch in your application repository.
* Include artifact repository configuration in the `pom.xml` file.
* Align your Cloud Foundry spaces with the Spring Cloud Pipelines model (isolated test space and shared stage and prod spaces).

*Better*

* Include `default`, `apicompatibility`, `smoke`, and `e2e` profiles in the `pom.xml` file.
* Organize tests accordingly in your application repository.

*Best*

* Use a database migration tool, such as Flyway.
* Use contract-based API programming.

Implementing all the *"`good`"* practices positions you to instantly create pipelines for your applications by using Spring Cloud Pipelines. This is a huge win in terms of consistency and productivity and standardization across development teams. Of course, this is an open source project, so you can modify it to meet your needs.

Implementing the *"`better`"* practices ensures the proper tests get run at the proper time. At that point, you can add as much test coverage as you need to have high confidence in your pipelines.

Implementing the *"`best`"* practices gives you additional confidence in your pipeline and encourages better programming practices for database version and API management across development teams. It also gives you higher confidence in your pipelines and lets you avoid the cumbersome business of rolling back a database.

Happy coding!
