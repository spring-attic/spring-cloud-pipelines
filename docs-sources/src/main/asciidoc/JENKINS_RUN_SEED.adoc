We already create the seed job for you but you'll have to run it. When you do
run it you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global env variables you have to remove them from the
seed.

Anyways, to run the demo just provide in the `REPOS` var the comma separated
 list of URLs of the 2 aforementioned forks of `github-webhook` and `github-analytics'.
