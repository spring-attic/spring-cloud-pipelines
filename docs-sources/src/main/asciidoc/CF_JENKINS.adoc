== Jenkins Pipeline (Cloud Foundry)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter, we assume that you deploy your application
to Cloud Foundry PaaS.

[[jenkins]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains job definitions and the opinionated setup pipeline, which uses the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL plugin]. Those jobs form an empty pipeline and a opinionated sample pipeline that you can use in your company.

The following projects take part in the `microservice setup` for this demo.

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics[Github Analytics]: The app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging -- part off our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]: Project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics -- part of our business application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka]: Simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot]: Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics and using Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-cf]]
=== Step-by-step

This is a guide for the Jenkins Job DSL based pipeline.

If you want only to run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose, do the following:

. <<jenkins-fork-cf,Fork Repositories>>
. <<jenkins-start-cf,Start Jenkins and Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-deploy-cf,Deploy infra to Artifactory>>
. <<jenkins-pcfdev-cf,Start PCF Dev (if you do not want to use an existing one)>>
. <<jenkins-seed-cf,Run the Seed Job>>
. <<jenkins-pipeline-cf,Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-cf]]
==== Fork Repositories

[[jenkins-fork-cf]]
Four applications compose the pipeline:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only the following, because only then can you tag and push the tag to your repository:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics/[Github Analytics]

[[start-jenkins-cf]]
==== Start Jenkins and Artifactory

[[jenkins-start-cf]]
Jenkins + Artifactory can be ran locally. To do so, run the
`start.sh` script from this repository. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/jenkins
./start.sh yourGitUsername yourGitPassword yourForkedGithubOrg
----
====

Then Jenkins runs on port `8080`, and Artifactory runs on port `8081`.
The parameters are passed as environment variables to the Jenkins VM,
and credentials are set. That way, you need not do
any manual work on the Jenkins side. In the above parameters, the third parameter
could be `yourForkedGithubOrg` or `yourGithubUsername`. Also the `REPOS` environment variable
contains your GitHub org (in which you have the forked repos).

Instead of the Git username and password parameters, you could pass `-key <path_to_private_key>`
(if you prefer to use key-based authentication with your Git repositories).

[[deploy-infra-cf]]
===== Deploy the Infra JARs to Artifactory

[[jenkins-deploy-cf]]
When Artifactory is running, run the `tools/deploy-infra.sh` script from this repo. The following listing shows the script:

====
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----
====

As a result, both the `eureka` and `stub runner` repositories are cloned, built,
and uploaded to Artifactory.

[[start-pcf-dev-cf]]
==== Start PCF Dev

TIP: You can skip this step if you have CF installed and do not want to use PCF Dev.
In that case, the only thing you have to do is to set up spaces.

WARNING: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
If that happens <<jenkins-cf-resources,clear some apps from PCF Dev and continue>>.

[[jenkins-pcfdev-cf]]
You have to download and start PCF Dev, as described https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev[here.]

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
----
====

You can start PCF Dev as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf dev start
----
====

You must create three separate spaces, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
----
====

You can also run the `./tools/cf-helper.sh setup-spaces` script to do this.

[[jenkins-seed-cf]]
==== Run the Seed Job

[[jenkins-pipeline-cf]]
==== Run the `github-webhook` Pipeline

[[optional-steps-cf]]
=== Jenkins Cloud Foundry Customization

You can customize Jenkins for Cloud Foundry by setting a variety of environment variables.

NOTE: You need not see all the environment variables described in this section to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to make custom changes.

If you already have in your system a credential to (for example) tag a repository,
you can use it by passing the value of the `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID` property.

TIP: See the `cf-helper` script for all the configuration options.
