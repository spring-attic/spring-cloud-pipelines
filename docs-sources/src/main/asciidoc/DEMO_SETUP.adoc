For the demo scenario we have two applications. `Github Analytics` and `Github Webhook`.
Let's imagine a case where Github is emitting events via HTTP. `Github Webhook` has
an API that could register to such hooks and receive those messages. Once this happens
 `Github Webhook` sends a message by RabbitMQ to a channel. `Github Analytics` is
 listening to those messages and stores them in a MySQL database.

`Github Analytics` has its KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) monitored. In the case
of that application the KPI is number of issues.

Let's assume that if we go below the threshold of X issues then an alert should be
sent to Slack.
