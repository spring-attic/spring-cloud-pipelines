== Jenkins Pipeline (Common)

In this section we will present the common setup of Jenkins for any platform.
We will also provide answers to most frequently asked questions.

=== Project setup

In the `declarative-pipeline` you can find a definition of a `Jenkinsfile-sample.groovy` declarative
pipeline. It's used together with the Blueocean UI.

In the `jobs` folder you have all the seed jobs that will generate pipelines.

- `jenkins_pipeline_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_jenkinsfile_empty.groovy` - is a template of a pipeline with empty steps using the Pipeline plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample.groovy` - is an opinionated implementation using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
- `jenkins_pipeline_sample_view.groovy` - builds the views for the pipelines

In the `seed` folder you have the `init.groovy` file which is executed when Jenkins starts.
That way we can configure most of Jenkins options for you (adding credentials, JDK etc.).
`jenkins_pipeline.groovy` contains logic to build a seed job (that way you don't have to even click that
job - we generate it for you). Under the `k8s` folder there are all the configuration
files required for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

In the `src` folder you have production and test classes needed for you to build your own pipeline.
Currently we have tests only cause the whole logic resides in the `jenkins_pipeline_sample` file.

=== Optional customization steps

[[jenkins_optional]] All the steps below are not necessary to run the demo. They are needed only
when you want to do some custom changes.

[[deploying-infra]]
==== Deploying infra jars to a different location

It's enough to set the `ARTIFACTORY_URL` environmental variable before
executing `tools/deploy-infra.sh`. Example for deploying to Artifactory at IP `192.168.99.100`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines
cd spring-cloud-pipelines/
ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://192.168.99.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" ./tools/deploy-infra.sh
----

[[setup-settings-xml]]
==== Setup settings.xml for Maven deployment

TIP: If you want to use the default connection to the Docker version
of Artifactory you can skip this step

[[jenkins-settings]] So that `./mvnw deploy` works with Artifactory from Docker we're
already copying the missing `settings.xml` file for you. It looks more or less like this:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <id>artifactory-local</id>
  <username>admin</username>
  <password>password</password>
</server>
----

If you want to use your own version of Artifactory / Nexus you have to update
the file (it's in `seed/settings.xml`).

[[setup-jenkins-env-vars]]
==== Setup Jenkins env vars

[[jenkins_env]] If you want to only play around with the demo that we've prepared you have to set *ONE* variable which is the `REPOS` variable.
That variable needs to consists of comma separated list of URLs to repositories containing business apps. So you should pass your forked repos URLs.

You can do it in the following ways:

- globally via Jenkins global env vars (then when you run the seed that variable will be taken into consideration and proper pipelines will get built)
- modify the seed job parameters (you'll have to modify the seed job configuration and change the `REPOS` property)
- provide the repos parameter when running the seed job

For the sake of simplicity let's go with the *last* option.

IMPORTANT: If you're choosing the global envs, you *HAVE* to remove the other approach
(e.g. if you set the global env for `REPOS`, please remove that property in the
seed job

[[setup-seed-props]]
===== Seed properties

Click on the seed job and pick `Build with parameters`. Then as presented in the screen below (you'll have far more properties to set) just modify the `REPOS` property by providing the comma separated list of URLs to your forks. Whatever you set will be parsed by the seed job and passed to the generated Jenkins jobs.

TIP: This is very useful when the repos you want to build differ. E.g. use
different JDK. Then some seeds can set the `JDK_VERSION` param to one version
of Java installation and the others to another one.

Example screen:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/seed.png[]

In the screenshot we could parametrize the `REPOS` and `REPO_WITH_BINARIES` params.

[[global-envs]]
===== Global envs

IMPORTANT: This section is presented only for informational purposes - for the sake of demo you can skip it

You can add env vars (go to configure Jenkins -> Global Properties) for the following
 properties (example with defaults for PCF Dev):

Example screen:

[[git-email]]
==== Set Git email / user

Since our pipeline is setting the git user / name explicitly for the build step
 you'd have to go to `Configure` of the build step and modify the Git name / email.
 If you want to set it globally you'll have to remove the section from the build
 step and follow these steps to set it globally.

You can set Git email / user globally like this:

[[jenkins-credentials-github]]
===== Add Jenkins credentials for GitHub

[[jenkins-credentials]] The scripts will need to access the credential in order to tag the repo.

You have to set credentials with id: `git`.

Below you can find instructions on how to set a credential (e.g. for Cloud Foundry `cf-test` credential but
remember to provide the one with id `git`).

=== Testing Jenkins scripts

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

=== How to work with Jenkins Job DSL plugin

Check out the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL[tutorial].
Provide the link to this repository in your Jenkins installation.

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).

=== Docker Image

If you would like to run the pre-configured Jenkins image somewhere other than your local machine, we
have an image you can pull and use on https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins/[DockerHub].
The `latest` tag corresponds to the latest snapshot build.  You can also find tags
corresponding to stable releases that you can use as well.
