== Building the project

=== Prerequisites

As prerequisites you need to have http://www.shellcheck.net/[shellcheck],
https://github.com/sstephenson/bats[bats], https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq]
 and https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[ruby] installed. If you're on a Linux
 machine then `bats` and `shellcheck` will be installed for you.

To install the required software on Linux just type the following commands

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y ruby jq
----

If you're on a Mac then just execute these commands to install the missing software

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install jq
$ brew install ruby
$ brew install bats
$ brew install shellcheck
----

=== Bats submodules

To make `bats` work properly we needed to attach Git submodules. To have them
initialized either clone with appropriate command

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
----

or if you have already cloned the project and are just pulling changes

[source,bash]
----
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
----

=== Build and test

Once you have installed all the prerequisites you can execute

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

to build and test the project.

=== Generate readme

To generate readme just run

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew generateDocs
----

== Releasing the project

=== Publishing A Docker Image

When doing a release you also need to push a Docker image to Dockerhub.
From the project root, run the following commands replacing `<version>` with the
version of the release.

[source,bash]
----
docker login
docker build -t springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version> ./jenkins
docker push springcloud/spring-cloud-pipeline-jenkins:<version>
----
