You can also use the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[declarative pipeline] approach with the
https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean UI].

The Blue Ocean UI is available under the `blue/` URL (for example, for Docker Machine-based setup: `http://192.168.99.100:8080/blue`).

The following images show the various steps involved:

IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting a pipeline from a specific stage after failure.

WARNING: Currently, there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins
blocks an executor when a manual step is required. That means that you run out of executors
pretty quickly. See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[this issue]
and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42561241/how-to-wait-for-user-input-in-a-declarative-pipeline-without-blocking-a-heavywei[this StackOverflow question]
