You can also use the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[declarative pipeline] approach with the
https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean UI]. Here is a step by step guide to run a pipeline via
this approach.

The Blue Ocean UI is available under the `blue/` URL. E.g. for Docker Machine based setup `http://192.168.99.100:8080/blue`.

IMPORTANT: There is no possibility of restarting pipeline from specific stage, after failure. Please

WARNING: Currently there is no way to introduce manual steps in a performant way. Jenkins is
blocking an executor when manual step is required. That means that you'll run out of executors
pretty fast. You can check out this https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36235[issue] for
and this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42561241/how-to-wait-for-user-input-in-a-declarative-pipeline-without-blocking-a-heavywei[StackOverflow question]
